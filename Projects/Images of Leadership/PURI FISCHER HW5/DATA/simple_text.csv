0,18241,F,"Leadership is influencing and directing others in pursuit of a common goal. The many sticky notes and side discussions occurring in the photo are steps toward the projects listed on the paper (“Community Garden,” “Immigrant Support,” etc.). In this image, the two people standing are exhibiting leadership, discussing and collaborating with other group members to move forward toward their common goal. Leadership involves not only sharing and pursuing your ideas but also considering and inviting new ideas. In this image and most scenarios involving leadership, the members sitting around the table are of various ethnicities, races, gender and sexual orientations, ages, etc. This diversity of identity and experience leads to more innovative and creative direction for the group, and true leaders bolster this and see diversity as a strength."
1,18240,F,"I chose an image of a group of individuals hiking up a mountain, where one individual takes initiative and leads the group in order to work towards a common goal. All of these people want to reach to the top of the mountain, but they need to work together in order to achieve this. Leadership can be shown in many different forms. I believe that a true leader takes the first step in order to inspire and motivate others. A leader has a clear agenda that will benefit the group as a whole, and has the ability to manage these individuals in a decisive and organized manner. Leaders recognize that clear communication within a group is what fuels success, empowering each other to work to the best of their abilities within a shared workspace."
2,18237,F,"Leadership is about uniting and inspiring people to follow your ideas. In this picture, my IB program coordinator holds a team-building event with the IB students and teachers. Despite their different professional and academic experiences, as a leader, she managed to inspire them to become part of the Swiss educational program she’s passionate about. She’s also put much time and effort into persuading a local school to start offering IB courses. Thus, without her inherent charisma and determination, she wouldn’t have created such a close-knit group of IB learners and teachers in Russia, a country that’s far away from Switzerland, and enriched her community with more educational opportunities.  
"
3,18236,F,"This image of my older sister and I as children captures the essence of leadership to me because to me, a leader is someone that can understand others and accommodate to their needs. A good leader is able to understand the abilities, needs, and capacities of each individual, and can cater to both the individual and the group. When I was young, my sister was this type of leader in my life— I wouldn't and couldn't do anything without her, so she would always accommodate to my needs. She led me through anything I couldn't or didn't want to do on my own, and was there for me every step of the way. To me, being a leader mean s being open to change, understanding each individual member, engaging a team on many levels, and encouraging their best efforts."
4,18233,F,"There is a common misconception that leaders stand alone — that they stand ahead everyone else as in they lead the crowd. However, the most effective leader is one who leads from within the masses. A true leader is someone who is able to hold up the hands of his or her counterparts, instilling a feeling of camaraderie, safety, and reliability amongst those he or she is around. Someone who is grounded with compassion and understanding for the day-to-day routine and struggles that the everyday person experiences resonates more deeply with people over someone who is detached. A good leader uplifts those that they lead, striving to better their experiences and make a real difference while also listening to others’ needs. A great leader does all of this from within"
5,18230,F,"At its core, I believe that leadership is the mechanism that allows for execution and implementation of a vision through utilization of an outward mindset. Leadership allows an individual or group to influence the people around them to believe in their vision, helping mentor and develop those individuals into a strong team that can turn the vision into a reality, ideally one that positively impacts society. That’s why I selected the image of a person guiding a group of people through the dark with a flashlight—often, leaders are pushing the envelope with ideas that don’t seem wholly plausible, but with the “light” of their leadership, they are able to guide their team through the unknown, and push boundaries to explore new frontiers of human capability. "
6,18229,F,"For me, this group photo captures the essence of leadership. While a part of the reason would be that everyone included in this picture was indeed leading their social welfare project, what stands out more to me is the fact that we were all joined in the same setting thanks to the people at the front of the photo - administrators of a foundation that aims to connect all students working towards sustainability. If separate, our project might have progressed well or faltered, but being in a community of like-minded people cemented the urge to keep the project going no matter what, and the foundation’s achievement of creating that much-needed community for us is why this photo stands strong as my interpretation on the essence of leadership."
7,18227,F,"A few months ago, my family visited Porto Ferreira, a Portuguese wine business started in 1751, for a wine tour. I quickly came to learn about Antonia Ferreira, an exemplary leader who broke many glass ceilings for women in business. As part of the fourth generation of the Ferreira family, Antonia defied norms as she overtook business activities. She helped Ferreira innovate with new cultivation techniques and a focus on humanitarian support. Antonia worked to build hospitals and schools in vineyard regions as a way to support the wellbeing of Ferreira's farmers and workers. This in turn supported their families through new jobs and better opportunities. The values and incredible leadership of Antonia Ferreira continues to inspire and resonate with me as a woman in business."
8,18226,F,"Leadership is a team effort. Leadership means building bridges with each other, utilizing the various skills, perspectives, and backgrounds people have. Guiding each other is critical in leadership to achieve success or a common goal, and there can be many leadership styles that people exhibit. This means that people can learn from different leadership styles as well and support each other in their personal and professional development. To do so, we all have to communicate effectively to build bridges of connection with one another while understanding that everyone has unique experiences and leads in their own way. It takes more than one individual to lead and practice leadership skills. Therefore, for me, leadership, at its core, comes down again to working together and supporting each other."
9,18225,F,"To me, leadership is the ability to influence and be an uplifting power. Leadership requires charisma. In the image, the girl with the megaphone cheers and encourages those ahead of her, as does the girl clapping below. Leaders celebrate their team’s successes and progress to empower the group. The image portrays people giving each other a hand, they work together to make it to the top. A good leader does not just command their peers to do things, they have to care about the growth the team as a whole and be able to work collaboratively to assure that the goals of all are met."
10,18221,F,"Leadership is our responsibility whenever we are put in a position of power, whether that means we have more experience in an organization or are formally assigned a leadership position. We must constantly look around us, be aware of the people struggling to climb to where we are, and help them up. That is the true essence of leadership: supporting others in your community from the place you've worked hard to get to.  Towards the end of my high school career, I was a leader by supporting classmates younger than me to gain the skills and positive experiences I had gained in clubs and classes. Even in organizations where I was not formally assigned a leadership position, I encouraged and gave advice to younger members.

11,18220,F,"Leadership, in my opinion, is taking charge - being a catalyst for positive evolution - while displaying the traits of love, kindness, and respect. Essentially, it's teaching people, through example. A good leader knows how to discipline and initiate without demeaning or stripping people of their humanity. I chose this image of my parents, because they will forever be my biggest role models. They've taught me everything I know about not only being a good student and functioning member of society, but also being a good person. By raising me with the upmost care and displaying the same love for others, conscientiousness, and strong work ethic that they expected from me, I learned, and was led - fueled by the desire to make them proud - to become stronger, wiser, and kinder."
12,18218,F,"I associate the concept of leadership with a circle of people giving each other back rubs. Although this initially seems like an odd image, there are two reasons for this. Firstly, a leader allows a person's personal critical thinking style to flourish within the confines of their expectations, not by implementing restrictions, but by using fluid boundaries that guide and encourage creativity. Essentially, the boundaries are shaped by the circle of people--their ideas, values, and work styles. Furthermore, it is also vital for a leader to develop relationships with all their team members in order to lead with empathy, which is why there are a part of this circle. Through their strong interpersonal communication skills, they must demonstrate mutual respect to everyone on their team and invest time working one-on-one with individuals to cultivate a team that functions as a unit (or more specifically, a mutually beneficial circle where everyone gets a back rub). "
13,18217,F,"A business with fixed strategies cannot survive in times that are constantly changing; each, with unique character and value, must take risks in the name of innovation. To me, trailblazing the business world, expanding business into unmarked territory, and the constant and passionate pursue of creative solutions in order to do so is the true essence of leadership. As a girl with high interest in both business and fashion, take Coco Chanel for example: she introduced to the industry new designs, expanded fashion into fragrance, and created an aesthetic that to this day lives on in her memory and in an extremely successful, timeless luxury brand. She was an innovator and a trailblazer, making her a true business leader.

14,18211,F,"Leadership can look different in everyone's eyes and can also be defined in many different ways. Leadership to some may be someone that tells them what to do or where to go. To others it may be someone to look up to. To me leadership still encompasses all these things, but the essence of leadership is making sure everyone is where they need to be and not falling behind or afraid to ask for help. This image presents leadership in that the leader (the person at the front of the line) looks back to check on his team. He is making sure everyone is where they need to be. In addition, he links his hand with the line ensuring that no one is falling behind."

 This image captures the essence of leadership by showcasing qualities that a leader radiates. The leader's attentive posture and engagement with the team exemplifies empathy and genuine concern for her surroundings, which is key to leadership. This signifies the leader's commitment to fostering growth and well-being among her team. This reflects a leader's ability to inspire her team by making her presence in the room known. This image captures leadership as a partnership, emphasizing the leader's role in nurturing her team's potential. Through capturing the attention of individuals in the room, the leader empowers others, fostering a sense of belonging and commitment. This encapsulates the heart of leadership: guiding and cultivating a cohesive and motivated team, all while demonstrating the transformative impact of compassion-driven leadership.

16,18208,F,I selected this image because I think that being a strong leader requires reliance and perseverance. A leader's main responsibility should be to inspire and guide their team towards a common goal. They must successfully navigate through difficulties while demonstrating the positive actions and attitude to achieve them. I also went with this image because I think it captures the connection between a leader and their team. In order for a team to succeed there needs to be a strong foundation built around trust and relationships. These bonds are established over time through experiences and open communication. Being a leader requires both patience and consistency. It’s not always easy taking on such a role. To stay on the right path one must be flexible and able to adapt if things change.
17,18205,F,"Courage, perseverance, and collaboration are necessary to emphasize teen voice and accomplish a team's common goal. In after-school matters, a non-profit organization in Chicago aims to leave a mark on low-income and minority neighborhoods through events, murals, and programming. A leader is not only defined through their words but actions. This image illustrates how collaboration between teens can evolve into opportunities to make a difference in neighborhoods. After-school matters helped and collaborated with smaller artists of low-income and minority communities for an art showcase. As a result, this changed the mindset of how society views the neighborhood in violence to light the creativity within the area. A leader isn't defined by age or access to resources but by having the drive to make a change."
18,18203,F,"The image I chose is one in which diversity is highlighted. This captures the essence of leadership because a great leader is someone who can bring a variety of opinions, thought-processes, and people together. Leadership is having the ability to listen to differing individuals and find common threads between each of them. Many of us come from unique backgrounds and have experiences that others cannot always relate to. Being able to lead means being able to bridge the divides amongst people. It means finding ways to hear everyone's voice and make each person feel valued. It is the emphasis on diversity that makes a leader great. "
19,18202,F,"I believe that the essence of leadership is being a supportive teammate. A good leader is not necessarily someone who gives out the best commands, but rather a fellow teammate that provides guidance and support to keep the team stable and progressive. As seen in the image, the ""leader"" in the red suit is holding up the bridge for his teammates to safely pass a challenging situation. He is not the first one crossing the bridge to save his own life, but is actually in a more sacrificial position than the others by holding up the bridge from below. This image effectively captures some essential traits of a good leader, including being supportive and being willing to sacrifice themself for the good of the team."
20,18200,F,"Immediately upon looking at the picture, you notice a person directing others toward a specific target. This captures the essence of leadership because it shows how leaders help a group reach their goals. Leaders set up a path that helps everyone involved reach their target. The reason why I selected this image specifically is because the leader is not at the front of the pack. Being a leader is not always about being the first to the target or to succeed. Being a leader is about setting up the most effective path to get everyone where they need to be. In this scenario, the leader would not have been able to set up a bridge for others if they had been in the front. Instead, they selected the most effective plan for achievement which is what leadership is all about."
21,18198,F,"Leadership is managing a group in order to complete a common goal. It emphasizes overseeing a wide variety of people, each complete with various opinions, backgrounds, interests etc. To become a leader, one should champion the differences in all, while still keeping what makes each person unique in mind. This could involve adapting teaching methods to suit one individual or adopting a newfound way of thinking. Leaders must be able to pivot and be inclusive. The following image represents the core of leadership as it shows a diverse group. A talented leader ensures inclusion: those who feel safe/comforted are more often to become leaders themselves. In all, leadership is more about those who are being taught and the mentality of the teacher.

22,18197,F,"Leadership is using your skills and knowledge to reach your goals while influencing and guiding others to reach their goals as well. A leader inspires, empowers, and guides their team towards success through communication and determination. In the image, the ""leader"" carries the flag, because he has useful knowledge and ideas to share with his team members, and he has taken the initiative to lead his team to their goal. The image really captures my understanding of leadership because it shows the ""leader"" also looking back and holding hands with the team meaning he is determined to make not just himself, but everyone else be the best versions of themselves so that everyone grows, learns, and achieves their goals. Leaders like the one in the image make sure their teammates are not left behind."
23,18193,F,"I'm sure we have all seen this type of depiction in some form or another, probably taped to the wall of a classroom. Though slightly cliche and elementary, this image Is a eye opening illustration of what leadership means, and it has stuck with me for years. What was most noticeable to me was how a leader is seen as an equal. They are not above or worth more than their peers. They recognized the team all has a common objective and instead of designating responsibility and commanding others, they do their share while guiding and mentoring others. I also notice that In leadership, it is vital to inspire peers and give them a reason to work towards a goal. In this depiction, the leader is immersed in the work showing they are passionate about this mission, which will in turn motivate the others to follow. "
24,18192,F,"When thinking of leadership, many automatically assume the leader takes an ""alpha"" role — the one leading the pack and in the spotlight as the rest follow. However, to me, leadership is better represented in this photo. While it may be the case that a leader will take an official position in the front of the ""pack,"" more often than not, a leader is one who simply provides a necessary helping hand. Whether it be assisting others in their success from behind the scenes or providing a shoulder to lean on during difficult times, generosity and accessibility are two crucial traits when it comes to leadership. Instead of assuming a superior position, a leader should be willing to put aside their ego for the sake of others. In this photo, the leader is barely seen. Rather, the attention is on those they are assisting."
25,18190,F,"This image captures the essence of leadership in a variety of ways, and I believe this is because leadership isn’t limited to one trait, one act, or just one type of person etc. Through this image it can be seen that there are many sides to leadership and many ways in which leadership can be demonstrated. This image shows a person holding the flag and leading a group of people up a mountain with the goal of placing their flag at the top of the mountain. Here, this person is shown to be a guide given that they are leading the way up and a mentor given that they are looking back at the others in order to understand their perspective (compassion) and to use their experience to help their team reach their goal in a way best suited for them. This person has vision in the sense that they are able to look up the mountain and see that peak in order to guide the others towards a valued accomplishment. Furthermore, this person seems to be, in not having a hand to guide him up, stepping out of their comfort zone and stepping away from solely their best interests to a more uncomfortable role, in the sense that they have more responsibility and risk on themselves, in order to empower, coach, and facilitate their group. This also suggests that this person has competence, skill, and confidence in order to head up the mountain so seamlessly while guiding others rather than just looking forward for himself. Beyond just this one person leading, however, this picture shows leadership in the rest of the people pictured too. Here each person is a leader in their own way given the fact that they are all working towards a common goal in a manner that fosters a shared sense of purpose, meaningful connection, and in a manner that uplifts each other and challenges themselves to do something with and for the team. While they all are trying to get somewhere and to do something important to them, they are also making a path for those behind them & pulling those behind them along — influencing and inspiring those coming after them in the process. Even the last person in the line who isn’t guiding anyone up himself demonstrates leadership in the way that they are willing to be vulnerable to get the team ahead, and they are willing to not always be the only one leading (recognizing others' strengths over their own, letting others gain experience leading, and/or trusting those who are part of his team even if he may not be able to see the top of the mountain as clearly). In addition, this image shows a diverse set of people showing that leadership isn’t limited to a certain type of person (such as people of certain races or genders)."
26,18189,F,"For me, leadership means the ability to guide people through even the toughest of times. For example, in the image attached, George Washington is pictured leading the boat full of people to cross the Delaware River in the dead of night. Conditions were extremely harsh, yet he not only persevered, but had the grit and determination to inspire others to persevere as well. It didn't matter that his men hadn't eaten in days, wore only the barebones of military regalia, or that the river itself was a monster filled with ice and rushing currents to get through, Washington followed his vision and led the army to victory. In the picture, he is standing in the boat, looking ahead, acting like a pillar of strength and light that his men can lean on. Because of his vision, determination, and ability to power through even the fiercest of storms, George Washington is now one of our most respectable leaders in modern history."
27,18188,F,"This image depicts a lone duck that stands out from the rest as he appears in a bright color and wearing shades. The duck appears unbothered by his abnormal appearance and embraces his uniqueness. To me, the essence of leadership lies within one's confidence. Having the ability to confidently pursue decisions and influence others is a key characteristic of a strong leader. The best leaders are those not afraid to think outside of the box and offer a new outlook. This confidence can generate enthusiasm within a team, spark creative thinking, or create a feeling of trust and reliance on their leader. You can see many of the ducks are turned towards the ""leader"" only emphasizing the impact that confidence and authenticity carry within a leader."
28,18154,F,"I believe the essence of strong leadership skills is empathy. Empathy builds the foundation for interpersonal skills that considers the various backgrounds and opinions from others which enhances communication to reach a goal. Also, empathy is a crucial skill for active listening, compassion, and flexibility when working with others. The image I chose illustrates that you have to offer a helping hand to others in order to reach the finish line. Thus, leadership requires working together and not alone. Extending empathy towards others leads to increased respect and fosters a collaborative environment that is focused on achieving success by meeting others where they are at in life. Empathy also functions as a useful tool during stressful situations as it focuses on problem-solving skills and emotional regulation."
29,18153,F,"The image attached depicts a woman teaching students. The act depicted in the image demonstrates the essence of leadership by showcasing how the teacher is able to empower others to learn by imparting knowledge to her students and supporting their education and development. Furthermore, teachers adapt their methods to accommodate as many students as possible and a diverse array of individuals which demonstrates the quality of appealing to various personalities in leadership. Additionally, the teacher exhibits leadership through communication; by simplifying certain information to properly educate children, teachers are able to communicate with their students and aid them in grasping and learning information. Overall, by supporting the students’ education, fostering a community of inclusion, and properly communicating to a broad range of individuals, teachers, such as the one shown in the image, demonstrate leadership.

 The image encapsulates the essence of leadership. The leader's stance atop the hill, holding the flag, symbolizes their vision and direction, guiding the team towards a shared goal. This parallels the role of a leader who sets a clear path and inspires others through their unwavering commitment. The outstretched hands represent support, encouragement, and a willingness to uplift the team, highlighting the leader's dedication to collective progress. Leadership isn't about mere authority, but about fostering unity and growth. In essence, the image captures how a leader's strategic vision, guidance, and supportive nature combine to elevate the entire team towards success.

31,18149,F,"I chose this photo as it was taken at a time when I felt like a leader. I had just led my group to victory, after standing beside them throughout each step of hard work and every long hour of practice leading up to the accomplishment. Slowly, I helped cultivate an environment where every member of my group felt comfortable being themselves and empowered to put effort into our conjoined goal so that our victory would be felt as a source of pride for every person involved. Even during difficult times when morale was low, I continued to lead by example, the example of someone who was passionate and wanted to be a positive influence in our group, even on the long rides back from events (as pictured). I learned to become the type of leader that was needed by others in my group especially the newer, younger members, and with time that definition aligned with who I wanted to be as a leader."
32,18148,F,"To me, the essence of leadership is guiding others, even when it may be isolating, challenging, or uncomfortable. The image shows a single person guiding a large group of people, which can be daunting for many, but true leaders and leadership is the ability to work past those negative feelings for the betterment of the group, not the individual. Having the ability to selflessly guide others and point them in the right direction, as demonstrated in the picture, is the most important part of leadership in my opinion, as without selflessness and a group mindset, the entire group could suffer. The group puts their trust in the leader in the image, and the leader in turn looks out for their best interest."
33,18147,F,"I choose an image of a hand helping others cross a gap, enabling them to climb a mountain. I believe the purpose of leadership is to guide others into becoming the best version of themself, while building a team capable of accomplishing their vision. The highest priority of a true leader is service, putting the goals of the team and the growth of the team members first. A leader with this mindset is more capable of forming a successful and productive team than someone who approaches leadership with an authoritarian outlook. The servant leader should be the helping hand, the person that looks at the big picture and helps the rest of the team bridge the gaps between where they are and what they want to accomplish."
34,18146,F,"To me, listening is an important part of leadership. Being able to give other people the space to express their ideas and opinions freely will not only help the group dynamic but also show people that you are willing to give up part of your authority for the greater good. Leadership should not be only one person leading the whole group by themselves but it rather a collaborative effort. When everyone is able to incorporate their ideas together, it gives different and new perspectives on the topic at hand which can make the process go faster. Active listening also helps others feel appreciated as they know you paid attention to what they said. Making everyone feel part of the group will encourage others to speak out more and increase their moral of being there."
35,18145,F,"Successful leadership can be defined as guiding a team to achieve a common goal while having everyone’s best interests at heart and creating a healthy environment where their greatest talents are cultivated. In the picture attached, the figure with the flag who is leading the group is facing backward with his arm outstretched in order to pull up the people following closely behind. I thought that this captured the essence of leadership because an effective leader is a strong communicator who inspires and coaches rather than relies on authority to demand productivity. By looking back and holding hands with the people who are following behind, the leader in this picture is creating a culture of “us"" and focusing on relationship-building, strengthening the team at large. "
36,18144,F,"The image posted depicts a leader as a hero, but I believe that is an idealistic perception of leadership and what it entails. However, the image does capture the devotion inspired in those being guided by a true leader. The essence of leadership is being able to inspire those under your guidance to not do as you will, but to be willing to follow in your footsteps and trust your guidance. A hero, as depicted, puts their community's needs before their own: as a leader in whichever organization would. Beyond that, it is being courageous and capable enough to be at the forefront of change and creating a mechanism that sets yourself and your community/organization for success."
37,18142,F,"I believe the essence of leadership is service. A leader should seek to serve their team, providing support in a way that aligns its members in pursuit of a common goal. I therefore decided to choose this image, as it highlights how leadership is the act of empowering those with whom you're working. Rather than dominate over a team, a true leader lifts up their colleagues, providing productive guidance and oversight. Through this, each team member is able to improve. Additionally, the organization as a whole will benefit, as defining leadership through the essence of service ensures the creation of goals that ultimately satisfy clients and customers. By keeping their audience, the people they are serving, in mind, a leader will effectively guide its team on a path of improvement.

38,18141,F,"For me, the largest aspect of leadership is inspiration. I think that person truly becomes a leader when they have the ability to inspire others in their own lives and goals through their words and actions. Additionally, leaders should be inspired by those around them so that they are a true representation of their ""group"" or ""people"". This image shows thinking mechanisms being exchanged between brains which represents a two-way path of inspiration. Aside from this image, I think leadership should also include genuine support and care for others. When a person encourages and motivates another person, it demonstrates that they care for that person which naturally makes them a leader. Overall, I think leadership instinctively occurs when a person is inspiring, supportive, and caring."
39,18140,F,"I chose the former president of the Republic of Korea, Moon Jae In, as an image of leadership. His role in chaebol reform, anti-corruption measures, and inter-Korean summits showcases his leadership skills. By appointing a fair-trade commissioner with a reputation for being tough on chaebols, Moon took steps to make the Republic of Korea less oligarchical and more egalitarian. Leaders should value egalitarianism and ensure that power and resources are not exclusive to a small group. His anti-corruption measures also helped ensure that Korean economic prosperity benefitted the country as a whole. Out of OECD countries, South Korea has higher corruption rates and low rates of social mobility, so corporate corruption has effectively seeped into the government. The inter-Korean summits were very popular in Korea and Moon even visited North Korea himself. Reunification is a controversial topic due to South Korean aversion to socialism; however, reunification is still important for humanitarian and sustainability reasons. Communicating with those who have different objectives than you, such as Moon's negotiations during the inter-Korean summits, is crucial in being a leader. To me, being a leader is defined by willingness to do the right thing and caring for the general welfare of the people."
40,18135,F,"A keystone species is a species that ensures an ecosystem can survive and flourish. Without keystones, ecosystems cannot properly function, decreasing their productivity, and eventually causing them to become defunct. Redwood trees are some of the most well-known examples of keystones. Everything within their environment is somehow connected and supported by the trees, building various networks, ultimately creating a forest. I believe a leader is someone who acts as a keystone species. They are the person who supports and sustains their ecosystem (whether it’s a corporate office or group project) and allows room for growth. As each individual in the system plays their own part, they create a mutualistic relationship where through leadership, the keystone holds everything together and supports every functioning component. "
41,18130,F,"When I think about leadership, nothing can serve as a better representation than my team from high school; I like to refer to my team as my second family because they serve a larger role in life than simply teammates. My teammates have shown me the power of trust, love, and true friendship - some of the most important qualities of leadership. The ""essence of leadership,"" at least to me, comes from the environment in which the leader is in. Being surrounded by a group of mentors who love and care for said leader is what pushes them to ""lead"" and be there for those around them. In regards to my position, the love, respect, commitment, etc. that my teammates have always shown for me was my driving force in leading them in all their endeavors; as such, to me there is truly nothing more representative of leadership than my team."
42,18127,F,"As a leader, you put yourself in a position to guide and motivate others. Leadership can be as simple as leading a group of people to a destination or as complex as leading your team to a championship. It is not just being in charge, but also lighting a fire people may not see in themselves to accomplish an objective. The picture displays a girl empowerment session I led at my old elementary school, Capitol Heights Elementary. The session began with me speaking to the girls about self-confidence and self-worth. Then, it ended with the girls creating hats to represent their aspirations. This picture is the basis of leadership because it shows a group building on one another's experiences and working for a collaborative goal. "
43,18124,F,"On Google, the word leader is defined as a “ person who leads or commands a group.” But to me, being a leader and showing one's leadership also includes leading by example, encouraging others during the process, and helping the followers become stronger people and leaders. My chosen photo shows 3 people reaching the summit of a mountain. The figure on the left being my “leader” who climbed the mountain with their 2 followers. The leader also helped them throughout the process up until the end (shown by pulling them up) and encouraged them along the way (shown with a triumphant and excited fist in the air), a perfect representation of my personal view of a leader."
44,18123,F,"To me, a leader is a person that knows how to guide their group, allowing the team to reach their desired goal. As seen in the image, the leader is not at the forefront of the group, but rather playing a role as someone providing a foundation for the team to confidently walk on. I would find that this leader is someone who understands the strengths and weaknesses of their team members and knows how to encourage them forwards through obstacles. 
 Thus, I would note that a leader is a foundational structure and gap-filler, allowing each team member to thrive in their expertise while finding ways to smooth over any difficulties that arise. Leadership glues a team so that each member is able to succeed together."
45,18121,F,"Leadership embodies selflessness and a heart devoted to serving others. At its core, it's the spirit of putting the needs and well-being of others before personal gain. Rather than viewing themselves as superior beings, leaders humble themselves before their team and channel their energies toward community and organization. The picture I chose represents just that: one figure gives the other figure a puzzle piece, even if that means sacrificing a part of himself. Mutual support and collaboration flourishes in an atmosphere where leaders prioritize the growth and development of their followers. This selfless approach promotes trust and fosters a healthy environment in which the team has a shared sense of purpose. Having a serving heart and a genuine willingness to uplift and give to others is the essence of leadership."
46,18120,F,"Leadership is often identified when individuals can guide a team toward achieving a common goal. However, the gist of leadership stretches far beyond one’s ability to lead. During my senior year, I was part of my high school’s volleyball team. As one of the oldest and most experienced players on the team, I was selected as the captain. I began with the mindset of leading the team to another regional finals title by aligning training goals and increasing morale. Yet, as the season went on, I discovered what a leader truly does. I became the bridge between underclassmen and upperclassmen, players and coaches, even teammates and opponents. It is all about connecting people and bringing the best out of others. There is no hierarchy in leadership. Instead, it is about building the best team as a whole. "
47,18119,F,"Leadership is not only the act of leading people, but it's also the act of helping those around them thrive and grow. In my eyes, the sun captures the essence of leadership as it is not only at the center of the solar system, but it is also a light source for the earth and provides everything on the planet with energy. Without the sun's energy, there wouldn't be any living organisms on Earth, and the whole system would collapse. Similarly, the lack of a leader not only leads to chaos amidst the group, but it also means that they lose all guidance and support from the leader. A leader is there to both lead by example and empower their people to thrive and succeed."

 There are various forms of leadership, and every leader has their own method when practicing their leadership style. Some leaders make decisions based on emotions, while others base their decisions on inputs from others. However, across all forms of leadership, there is an element of assistance or being a ""helping hand."" In this picture, the hand is helping the individuals cross a path that they wouldn't have been able to cross without the leader. The picture captures the essence of guidance and problem-solving, which are foundational attributes of leaders. It is important to note that not all leaders work towards productive goals; leaders like Adolf Hitler did not use their influence in a productive manner whatsoever. All in all, I believe that leadership is a state of mind or behavior that holds such profound energy and influence that others decide it's worth subscribing to as well.

49,18117,F,"This image captures the essence of leadership as the leader pulls up their peers, rather than weighing them down. The leader depicted has the motivation and determination to continue climbing up. Furthermore, the leader ensures that their peers have the support they need to keep advancing. When a team is united, the leader behind the team is successfully doing their job. Those that are climbing are all moving cohesively, proving that the leader effectively communicated a plan for their success. In addition, the image depicts arms that are holding hands. This symbolizes that the leader is building off of the support they received throughout their life. The leader is sharing that support with others and will inspire them to do the same."
50,18115,F,"This image captures my view of leadership because when I look at it, I could not distinguish who the leader is. Any person in the circle could be the leader, and one should not be able to tell who based on the appearance of one snapshot. I believe that true leadership is shown by the actions of one person behind the scenes. Of course, a leader still oversees their team, but in a way where they are not sitting on a higher pedestal. They respect the value of each member and recognize that they are still a part of an inclusive whole, hence the circular nature of this image. Ultimately, despite my inability to distinguish the leader in this image, I know that they exhibit the qualities of communication, accountability, and most importantly, courage."
51,18114,F,"For me, leadership is about someone who is able to guide others and help them find success in their own ways. People who are leaders do not think only about themselves but puts the needs of others before theirs because they understand the responsibility that they hold. Leadership can come in multiple forms from people with different backgrounds and experiences but the commonality that they all share is that they are willing to take control and make decisions that will help the greater good of people. The image below demonstrates this because of how one of the hands is pulling the other one up, illustrating how he is figuratively lifting the other person into a higher (better) place than he originally was. Leadership is all about being able to bring others up when leaders make successes which is why the image I chose was about someone helping to lift someone else up."
52,18110,F,"This image illustrates a group of dolphins working together to hunt fish. This photo captures the essence of leadership by displaying the natural behavior of dolphins in action as they work together to make survival easier. With communication through whistles, clicks, touch, and posture, dolphins are able to establish a strong group culture and build camaraderie with each other. An important aspect of leadership that dolphins are able to capture that humans oftentimes can not, is leadership without rank or seniority. Being able to shift leadership roles from one another dynamically and without hesitation ensures that the needs of any particular situation are met and that they are all able to be leaders."
53,18108,F,"I chose a picture of a person courageously jumping from one cliff to another. This risky leap of faith requires confidence, careful consideration, and vision. When I think about the essence of leadership, those same attributes come to mind. 
   
 To lead a group, a leader must first be confident in oneself. Confidence leads to clearer thinking, more effective communication, and better execution of plans.  Careful consideration comes into play in leadership when bringing a group of people together. Every person will have different needs and unique skill sets to share, and as a leader, the goal is to accommodate and form deeper relationships amongst the group. Successful group connecting requires thoughtful consideration of each individual's experiences and how they play into group dynamics.  Lastly, vision is the cornerstone of leadership. Setting a clear vision provides purpose and direction not only for the leader but for the entire team. The vision reminds us that we're a part of something bigger than ourselves and inspires and motivates us to persevere through challenging times."
54,18107,F,"This image represents leadership to me because not only is there an obvious leader at the front, but they are using the tools they have been given, in this case a megaphone, to help the people following them. In a real life depiction these tools may be character traits and qualities, but a good leader must know how to use these in ways which encourage and build up the people around them. The person with the megaphone in the image is using these tools to help the others reach greater heights and although it may not be climbing up steps, leadership works exactly like this. Being a good leader means much more than then bringing up yourself, it means doing your best to bring everyone else around you up as well."
55,18106,F,"The essence of leadership is the ability to embrace differences and use them to your advantage. In this photo, I had challenged myself to teach English in Somalia. Having grown up in the United States, I could not be more different the girls I was teaching whom I shared an ethnic background with. My Somali was heavily accented and initially felt like a barrier between proper communication. However, I was able to lead using my differences as a form of education. I ended up bonding with the girls in my class due to being able to compare our experiences and learn from their insights. I learned more about Somali culture while my students learned more about American culture, allowing me to lead using our differences."
56,18105,F,"This image captures leadership because we can see that even though one man already got to the goal, he is helping the other get to it too. This is leadership as the man could have had the win for himself, however he decided to stay back and help the other. Leadership means having the ability to lead other people towards a goal, and try to help them throughout the way. In order to be a leader, you have to take responsibility, give others direction and understand that it goes beyond just giving orders. A good leader has to motivate and empower those who follow him in order for them to achieve the goal. I believe that this image is a perfect example of what leadership looks like. 
"
57,18101,F,"While simple, this picture depicts what I believe is a major part of effective leadership - a service mindset. The leader in the picture holds up their members in a fashion similar to holding up a trophy, implying that all their success is derived from the work of the employees. The employees are essentially the organization (organizations only exist because of its members) so focusing on the growth, development, and well being of employees would affect the organization in a directly proportional manner. Furthermore, these notions are supported by the previous economical and communal success of past leaders in humanitarian as well as corporate fields who emulated service leadership such as Susan B Anthony, Lincoln, or Ghandi."
58,18100,F,"A hearty campfire captures my understanding of the essence of leadership. 
   
 Just as how sparks at the start of a fire can be easily snuffed out, leadership is a developmental process. Everyone makes mistakes along their leadership journey, and it is up to the individual to pick themselves up, learn, and slowly develop their unique leadership style. 
   
 Moreover, the raging heat emanating from a campfire can be likened to a leader’s burning passion. Leadership often means devotion and sacrifice, which can only be achieved when a leader vehemently feels for the cause they are serving. 
   
 Last, the ambers at the end of a campfire signify a leader’s legacy even after they have left. Like how ambers can be relit into a new fire, an effective leader’s contribution continues inspiring the work of future generations.

59,18040,F,"This painting titled  Washington Crossing the Delaware  by Emanuel Leutze was the first thing I thought of when I thought of leadership. Washington knew he had to be a strategic leader because the revolutionaries faced many losses before this. Therefore, Washington led his troops into a severe storm on Christmas day to surprise the Hessians. That was the first significant victory for the Continental Army. The army's success would not have been possible if George Washington hadn't led them because it was a turning point in the war. To be a good leader, they must be powerful and able to make good decisions. Leadership includes problem-solving and creativity, which Washington displayed in the victory at Trenton.

60,18037,F,"I believe that listening is an important part of leadership. A good leader is a good listener. When one thinks about the word leadership, they tend to think about a commander who is in control of their team. However, a good leader also needs to communicate with their team members and an essential part of communication is listening. A successful leader listens to the ideas and concerns of their group in order to help the team. An example would be the leader of a group project. The leader should listen to their group mates in order to understand which tasks each member wants to do rather than just assigning them to different tasks. This way each member can do a task that they feel passionate about, leading to a successful group work. "
61,18035,F,"The essence of leadership is pushing others ahead of yourself. This image of a football player depicts a captain or a leader on the team letting the team walk out of the tunnel onto the field before he does. It is expected that captains on a team should be the ones in front of the pack, receiving all the glory and recognition first as they sprint out onto a court, field, or even while walking into a business meeting. But my understanding is that a leader is behind the pack. A leader ensures that there are no strays left behind, no one lacking confidence in their capability, and no one unsure about their role in the community they belong to. A leader creates a culture for people to thrive."
62,18034,F,"To me, leadership is lifting others up and providing them with guidance. In the image, the middle person is united with the group around him, but he appears to be sharing his success and bringing others up. Also, a leader should not claim all of the success of a group effort. They could lead the way, but acknowledge the efforts of the other contributors. Leaders are someone people that set a positive example of how something should be so that others can follow in their footsteps. To me, leading by example is the best way. It is important to take charge when you can, but not in a demeaning way and this is shown by the uplifting photo of leadership. Lead by uniting a group."
63,18033,F,"Source:  https://www.joshuatree.guide/guide-to-the-night-sky  Joshua Tree Navigation Guide 
   
 Leaders have to know which direction to head in, and this photo of a star navigation guide represents the essence of leadership to me. No matter how the external variables change, as all the other stars move across the sky, a good leader must keep sight of their North Star and their own values as they help navigate their group to success. A leader must have the ability to step back and see the full picture, as a navigator must consider the whole sky. They also have a responsibility to those they are guiding, and must ensure that everyone is able to understand the roadmap they are following. Otherwise, the group is likely to fall apart and go astray."
64,18031,F,"The image selected is the jazz duo DOMi & JD BECK’s first album cover.  
   
 To me, leadership is the ability to bridge continuity and change within communities. Through collaborating with mainstream artists like Mac DeMarco and Snoop Dogg as well as jazz legends like Herbie Hancock alike, the duo makes jazz more accessible by breaking down the technical rabbit holes that exist within many enthusiast groups. In an interview with musicradar., they advise young musicians to not take themselves too seriously. “Get to the core of it [and abandon] facades and superficiality,” DOMi urges. They advocate for pursuing sounds they personally find interesting and to not adhere too strictly to traditional or industry standards. DOMi & JD BECK, while both extremely technically skilled, don’t prioritize elitist bullshit in their music; instead, they seamlessly integrate complex jazz chord progressions and scales (continuity) with fun, quirky production styles (change) to create their own fusion jazz genre. "
65,18030,F,"I believe the essence of leadership is trust. Effective leadership exists when the team members trust each other, and have faith in their leader’s unwavering support. As presented in the image, a group of members are crossing from one cliff to another. The hand that guides and supports them represents the leader’s role. In this scenario, the challenge a team faces is to reach the other side. In order to overcome this challenge, the team needs a leader who can empathize with teammates’ emotions, and equip them with the tools needed. Effective leaders lead by example and use their own actions to motivate their teammates to trust them. If team members do not trust this leader, they won't take the leap to overcome the challenge."
66,18028,F,"Leadership involves stepping forward boldly despite external pressure to backdown. Pictured here are my youth colleagues, Luna and Malika, along with myself, on the dais during the inauguration of a non-profit campaign launch. While holding leadership roles as Youth Advisory Board members in the organization we represent a minority of young individuals in this event. Yet, at this campaign's launch, we were authorized to stand on the podium, acknowledging our meaningful input to the organization. Leadership also encompasses the willingness to stand for what is right. During this campaign launch, we recognize the rightful stance of girls to take their place and present a speech on young people's contributions to the advocacy space."
67,18026,F,"This photo of a watering can providing water to the tree is how I see leadership. To be a leader, it is important for that person to provide the resources necessary (ex. water) to foster an environment of innovation to allow unique ideas to grow (symbolized by the tree). When working on an assignment as a group, the leader isn’t driving the conversation to only one desired solution to a problem. Leadership is not always linear from point A to B. The leader creates a place where everyone in a group can contribute their ideas, which promotes teamwork, allowing everyone to contribute their thoughts and ideas to play a part in the solution. Leaders can provide multiple resources (sun, water, soil, etc.) to help the group (tree) that they are leading grow."
68,18025,F,"I believe that at its core, leadership suggests interaction with others who look up to you and seek your guidance as you oversee the operations of the group. Exuding confidence, yet not an overbearing ego, a leader is able to strategize and direct others in a way that takes the whole group’s thoughts and needs into account. A teacher is a shining example of someone who must guide youth daily through mentorship, and design engaging strategies to mold them into who they will become in the future. A teacher must listen to their students and analyze their performance to best adapt the class to help the students succeed. I would say that invariably students look up to their teachers."
69,18024,F,"This image shows Lionel Messi embracing Argentina's goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez, after the round of 16 match against Australia in the 2022 Qatar World Cup. To me, this image captures the essence of leadership because we see a clear team leader, Messi, acknowledging and celebrating the contributions of other members of his team. In a team sport, no one person is more important than the other, and successful leadership can only be achieved if there is an understanding and appreciation for what each member can bring to the table. Essentially, in order for Messi to be a good leader, he must also be an active follower and listener, staying open to other people's ideas and supporting his team in success and failure. Sports, especially in an event like the World Cup, can be an intense and overwhelming, but a good leader needs to be able to consider and celebrate their other teammates even under immense pressure."
70,18023,F,"The image I chose encapsulates my person definition of the ""essence of leadership"" by portraying four people crossing the gap between two treacherous cliffs—with the direction of the leader's metaphorical palm. To me, leadership involves providing a sense of direction to those around you even in situations where this may cause difficult conversations or navigation through a series of complicated steps. A leader is a strategist and also one who is emotionally intelligent, providing solutions that are efficient and of best interest to everyone around them. I believe the essence of leadership also involves being the one to partake in less preferable positions for the betterment of everyone—such as being the main ""helping hand"" for the team. Overall, I believe a leader is a director and a role model.

71,18021,F,"A leader is someone who inspires and guides people towards a shared vision. The image shows this as the man on the left side of the picture pulls on a rope, bringing other people upward instead of abandoning the team and moving on his own. Just as the man in the green shirt empowers his team to stand on higher ground, effective leaders also strengthen others’ motivation to reach goals by recognizing individual strengths, delegating tasks, and encouraging innovation. By serving others first and valuing each person’s contribution, good leaders cultivate a positive working environment as well as trust and collaboration, as shown by the two hands holding each other. Ultimately, leadership is about unlocking potential in other people and facilitating personal and collective development."
72,18019,F,"I believe the essence of leadership is not about championing one’s ideas vocally and hogging the spotlight, but instead elevating one’s team members and giving them the space to shine. 
 
 The songbird’s method of motherhood encompasses something similar. Just as a mother bird gives her chicks the first push to fly, leaders aid in their members' growth by providing them with opportunities to challenge themselves and learn from the process. When one is fearful of stepping out of their comfort zone, it is the leader who steps up to motivate them, understanding their concerns before ultimately giving them the final push to move forward. A leader therefore is a mentor who is present for their members throughout and will enable constructive change in their mindsets.
"
73,18018,F,"Leadership seeps into every corner of life.   We had our first exposure to it in our family with our parents. At school, there are leadership positions we respected: principals, teachers, and etc. As we tackled on new paths of life, our understanding of leadership mold with the experiences we gain from first-hand exposure or stories from people who are far more wise than us. Yet, leadership isn’t solely a human experience. Animals conduct leadership parallel to their intelligence. Bees, specifically, are intelligent creatures with a complicated system of leadership. While queen bees are the soul of the colony, she depends on other bees to efficiently administer her decisions and strategies such as dances and pheromones to distribute communication. As leader, the queen bee's purpose is to serve her hive and once she’s deemed no longer purposeful, the other bees will replace her. This idea of give and return is fundamental in human’s perspective of leadership as well. Thus, the essence of leadership doesn’t have borders. Leadership isn’t limited to the individual (or bee) who from an outsiders’ view seems to be the one in control; rather, leadership is a concept that we all participate in: to have a say in who represents us, to spectate the performance of that representative, and to be active in the group’s activity is what makes leadership thrive."
74,18017,F,"In any kind of organized community, leadership is essential. For example, this picture illustrates a flock of birds making there way to their next destination. Birds tend to travel in a distinct way in which they all draft off of one another to spare as much energy as possible. The bird in the front of the arrow is expending the most amount of energy, allowing the rest of the birds in the flock to have an easier flight. This bird is an example of leadership because it is not only guiding the flock to their destination, but also sacrificing its energy and strength for the good of the community. Leaders should put others' needs before their own, while also taking charge by leading with confidence and determination."
75,18015,F,"Metaphorically, I believe this chess board effectively captures my understanding of leadership. Although some chess pieces such as the queen could be considered leaders, winning a game without the support of the other pieces is extremely difficult. Thus, this emphasises the necessity of a team and collaboration in leadership. I would classify the queen as a leader due to its natural possession of flexibility and adaptability (in terms of movement across the board). Both of these are crucial qualities in a leader. Nevertheless, leadership can be fostered through practice and not solely through natural means. The pawn, for example, may become a queen if it reaches the opposite side of the board. This is symbolic of the distinction between natural leadership and fostered leadership. 
 Image Citation: https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/setting-up-a-chess-board-611545"
76,18014,F,"I believe that this image captures leadership as a selfless and uplifting concept without solely emphasizing the power the leader holds. The most important part of leadership is wholehearted service. In the picture, you can hardly pinpoint who the leader is because they all seem to have equal strength, focus, and perseverance. Although it is often important to distinguish a leader for law & order, leaders should strive to make their followers as good, if not better than them. This image truly captures the idea of leading as building others up. The leading lion was able to mold his pride into leaders as well, rather than tearing them down. He had no superiority complex. I believe leadership should be about giving back, not power exertion. "
77,18012,F,"When I think about leadership, I think of three main traits: collaboration, responsibility, and resilience. The picture under ""Leader"" best represents these three traits of leadership. As we can see in the drawing, the leader is on a higher slope. The action displays collaboration as well as responsibility. The responsibility of a leader is to empower and work with the team they are leading. In addition to responsibility and collaboration, we can see an element of resilience. The clip is steep, and there are clear comical markers of a bit of instability and effort as the leader tries to help the other individual up. However, this instability does not stop the leader from continuously making the effort and trying their best. Overall, through the graphical elements of the image, the most important qualities of a leader: collaboration, responsibility, and resilience can be shown."
78,18010,F,"This picture represents leadership for me, because leadership is all about how much you are able to aid/help another person, and create an environment of teamwork. Leaders are the people that have you back, that give you a hand when you need it, and ultimately bring up others. In return, people usually seek guidance from that person, because they know that person will either have their back or guide them. The leaders aren't the ones that are the most outspoken, but how they are able to impact those around them. When I think about being a leader, I try to influence those around me and uplifting them."
79,18008,F,"This image depicts the essence of leadership because it highlights the idea of serving others, as well as community and common goals. The most significant aspect of being a leader is helping others and having their best interest in mind. By doing so you are able to create and maintain a positive relationship with those around you as well as the people who you are helping out. Leadership is not task done alone but in a group which is why a sense of belonging and community is needed in order to accomplish a shared aspiration all members are trying to achieve. The image demonstrates how they are working together to get to their goal of reaching the top of the mountain guided by the red flag."
80,18007,F,"Leadership is being willing to take risks and the consequences that come with them while being a pillar for those around you amidst emotional, physical, and mental adversity. Leadership is not about being universally liked; it's about holding others to the standard as you strive to exceed it in every facet. I believe Michael Jordan embodies this form of leadership as he led the Chicago Bulls to 3 NBA championships in 3 years. For example, when Dennis Rodman, a crucial member of the starting squad, took a shocking 48 hour holiday in Las Vegas in the middle of the 1998 NBA finals, Michael Jordan traveled to Vegas himself and brought him back. His ability to hold his teammates accountable in times of pressure is a keystone element of leadership. Another big piece of why this photo captures the essence of leadership is that Jordan embraces high-pressure/high-stress times as an opportunity to improve, which sets the example and tone for those around him on how to approach such situations, thus uplifting the team as a whole."
81,18005,F,"Leadership inherently implies the process of leading. The way I see it, a successful leader is one who leads their team through cooperation, mutual help, and respect. The leitmotif of leadership is thus making sure that all the gears (team members) are involved and interconnected and initiate the movement towards the end goal, delivering the desired result set by the leader. As seen in the picture, there is no distinction between the people at the front end of the project and the ones who are working at the back end of the structure. Both those positioned at the top and the bottom strive to keep the mechanism moving higher. Without the insightful coordination of a leader, the structure would stop advancing and shatter into pieces.

82,18001,F,"When I think of leadership, my first thought goes to the qualities that a leader should have. I believe a leader should be a role model and support for others, by demonstrating qualities such as commitment, determination, and the ability to adapt and overcome obstacles. The image attached shows a famous ballerina named Misty Copeland, who was the first black woman in the United States to receive the position of a principal dancer (the highest position) in a prestigious ballet company. I would say that Misty Copeland demonstrates the essence of leadership as she has demonstrated her commitment, hard work, and ability to adapt to her environment in order to overcome the obstacles she has faced throughout her journey. I believe this illustrates the essence of leadership as it inspires others to do the same and aspire to have the same qualities."
83,17998,F,"The essence of leadership lies in a leader's ability to empower others. Beyond simply authority or a title, influential leaders can envision a change, inspire others with their vision, and assemble a team to execute their aspirations. A leader’s vision is deeply rooted in a sense of purpose, and this powerful mindset drives a team to persistently work through any challenges to create an impact.  Personally, I believe that inspirational leaders are also willing to serve others, and they foster an environment where their team can feel valued, respected, and encouraged to grow. By remaining open-minded and receptive to different perspectives, great leaders can move the hearts of others and make incredible changes to the world around them and within the people beside them. "
84,17996,F,"The image I chose demonstrates my idea of the essence of leadership. The image shows a man standing up, speaking to a group of colleagues. In my opinion, leadership is all about being able to stand up and stand out while still listening to those around them and taking in those opinions. A leader is no one if they cannot communicate with the people they are leading. To me, the essence of leadership is balancing taking command and being a trailblazer for a group while still including all voices in decision making. The picture shows this balance by showing the so-called leader still standing up, demonstrating his position, while still enthusiastically interacting with and listening to those around him. Without either one of these components, a leader would be unsuccessful."
85,17995,F,"The essence of leadership is creating empowering relationships and communities through your influence and impact. No leader acts alone - only by forming relationships and strengthening them can other traits and values we see in leaders like trust, communication, confidence, and integrity come through. The photo I chose from my camera roll shows a team I worked with throughout my junior year of high school. In it, you see the hands of each member coming together in the middle. Only by connecting and forming strong relationships with one another could we really understand that the focus of our leadership was the people. It was through coming together with our common values, actions, and goals that we were able to impact communities and form relationships as leaders. "
86,17948,F,"In my opinion, the essence of leadership in a team environment is shown in this photo because of the way everyone seems to be focused on the same goal. While it is inferred, I think it is safe to assume that the leader is the one helping the person on the middle screen. Whether it is a problem that needs to be resolved or a funny video, I think it is important to note that the leader behind the middle screen seems to be going out of their way to help fix this issue. Another thing that I noticed is that everyone seems to be attentive and comfortable with what is going on. This shows that the leader is functioning well with the team. In order for a group to function it needs to be psychologically safe so people can ask questions or get help when needed. I think this photo is a great way of showing that."
87,17946,F,"I believe this picture represents the essence of leadership because it resonates with the two most important qualities a leader needs: altruism and courage. The guy in the middle is willing to help his mate in need and lend his trust to another mate throughout this process. Moreover, he is altruistic enough to endanger himself in order to do so. Choosing to rely on others, collaborate with others, trust others, and most importantly possess enough empathy and courage to bring a positive impact around one's environment by helping those who need it—especially in critical situations where others would not usually be daring enough to help—are skills that only true and good leaders can possess, and this is why this image captures the essence of leadership."
88,17945,F,"To me a compass is the best example of what leadership truly is. A compass gravitates and is pulled in a specific direction and that direction remains constant no matter how much we turn. North is always north, and south is always south. Being a leader requires persistence to stay resolute in one’s desires and goals. When my friend joined the Navy, I gifted him a naval compass. I did this because no matter where the sails of the ships might take him, a leader can always find their way back. Much like a leader a compass serves as a guide and a facilitator. It helps people get to where they want to go and points them in the right direction. A compass allows other to get lost in experimentation and take risks without fear, because the compass will always point north."
89,17943,F,"Leadership is an essential part of life which becomes evident through many forms. Whether the leader serves as a mentor or just someone who inspires, this person must live up to the highest standard in order to keep the general group sustainable and motivated. In other words, good leadership should always keep both parties happy. The image I chose captures my understanding perfectly. It depicts three people standing at the top of a mountain with their hands in the air while looking at the sunset. The person in the middle could potentially represent a leader who helped his group achieve a certain goal. In this case, the goal could have been a long hike to the peak of a mountain. In the end, both parties (the leader and his followers) seem satisfied with the result. No matter how difficult the hike is, everyone is excited and benefits from the result."
90,17940,F,"I believe that this image embodies the essence of leadership because it demonstrates the following aspects of what leadership entails: 
 Collaboration and communication: The photo shows an open and collaborative discussion between several members of a team. The leader appears open to suggestions and actively highlights specific areas on her team's notes, which highlights that she pays attention to her teammates' work and that she has the ability to encourage teamwork and honest communication. Her teammates also appear receptive to her comments, which shows that she demonstrates the ability to convey ideas clearly and effectively, 
 Engagement: The leader in this photograph looks like an active participant in her team's discussion. She is evidently engaged from the way that she stands to participate in the conversation rather than sitting down passively. This implies her commitment to the task that her team is tackling. 
 Drive and responsibility: The woman in the photo is leading the discussion, which shows her motivation in completing the task and her responsibility in ensuring everyone is on the same page."
91,17939,F,"I believe that this image captures the essence of leadership as it demonstrates one of the most important characteristics of being a leader: teamwork. Many believe that leaders need to take complete control and allocate tasks to others, without any assistance. However, I strongly believe that leadership is about supporting others and influencing a group of people to help complete a task. Leadership is about empowering and motivating others to help them reach their true potential. Leaders are not “bosses”; they are not designed to tyrannize or overwork others. They are knowledgeable figures that provide guidance and inspiration to a group, to help achieve (common) goals! Leaders create a vision for a team and help them to achieve it, as they possess the necessary skills to make informed decisions and solve problems effectively, with the assistance of those in ’their team."
92,17938,F,"During my freshman year, I decided to join my school's Speech & Debate team simply because they gave me a cookie at the club fair. Although a bit impulsive, it is still one of the best decisions I have ever made. Thanks to debate, I was able to gain critical skills such as public speaking and persuasion. Most importantly, however, debate taught me what it means to be a leader. Through my experience as the  captain of my Speech & Debate team, I came to realize that leadership is not just directing people or giving orders.  Rather, it’s about helping others realize and unlock the hidden potential within themselves. In many ways, leadership can feel like a form of art. See, great artists are able to transform blank canvases into pieces with meaning through simply combining colors. Similarly, a  great leader is able to recognize  the unique talents each individual within their team possesses and combine those talents to create change. "
93,17937,F,"Among some of the greatest movements and companies lies strong leadership, and within that, a capacity to mobilize individuals and speak to a wider audience. The essence of leadership goes beyond mere authority; it encapsulates a myriad of qualities that elevate an individual to become a beacon of direction, fostering growth and change. This image symbolizes how leadership is the ability to unify a group of people with different ideas and capabilities and focus them toward the direction they need to go. In order to shape the development of movements, people, and change, leaders must take a holistic view of the environment and the exceptions to the rules. Thus, at the heart of leadership lies vision, one that channels the focus and energy of a team, much like how rays of light are refracted toward the center of the magnifying glass and converge together. "
94,17935,F,"To me, leadership is a two-sided communication between the leader and the people. Despite the fact that it may not always be a win-win relationship, leadership is about compromise. You win some, you lose some. A leader will have to think about the benefits for the majority and emphasize on the final decision. As open-minded the leader must be, he/she must also be firm in his/her decision. This is why I chose a picture of a tree as from the top view, the leaves are easily swayed which means that the leader can listen to multiple opinions. But as you go down the tree, the stem and roots describe how the leader will now have to make his/her decision and be firm with it."
95,17930,F,"Leadership is the act of building others up and being willing to go the extra mile for another person. The essence of leadership is all about supporting those you lead and ensuring that everyone on the team understands what's going on and is making their way to the destination. Often, people see getting different opportunities or succeeding as a zero-sum game. Still, the essence of leadership is supporting others and sharing success through helping others get to the end destination. My chosen image shows a chain of people helping one another up a mountain. This reflects the essence of leadership, as everyone is helping one another out and sharing the experience of getting up the hill. The group values collective success rather than individual achievement."
96,17929,F,"The image above shows a team captain delivering a message to her teammates. I think leadership is taking responsibility for the people around you by doing your best to communicate your ideas to them. Based on the picture, the captain looks like she is actively speaking to her teammates — telling them her thoughts on how the game is proceeding and what she thinks the team can do to take the victory. She is not only communicating her ideas, but is also respecting her teammates' thoughts by listening to what they have to say. She demonstrates the essence of leadership by taking the initiative to better the team by speaking about the potential course of action. Her body language and her teammates body language also show that her words are getting through to her teammates."
97,17928,F,"The first thing I thought of when I was asked to think about the essence of leadership was a leader’s ability to utilize the unique strengths of every member on the team. The picture I drew encapsulates my understanding because the leader is able to bring out the strengths of each member to create an incredible final product. At the same time, successful leadership brings out feelings of trust amongst the whole team. This is able to foster many opportunities to learn from each other and allow every person, including the leader(s), to grow in some way. In addition, I think open-mindedness is a huge component of leadership. From the way I see it, willingness to learn and adapt while keeping the team on track is also part of the essence of leadership."
98,17924,F,"The image depicts a leader on the right who has a vision and acts on it. He runs a community service club and knows his club would never be successful without the help of others and becomes the person who guides their team. They are someone who finds a balance between professionalism and being personal to build close relationships with the team, and with that, understands the strengths and weaknesses of each team member, and shines a light to each of the members' assets in order to achieve the vision in the most efficient way. This leader they may oversee his team and act as the main person directing the conversation and project, but they are also collaborative and will work alongside their team, picking vegetables by their side in this case. They find passion in their project and help motivate members to be just as excited to reach their collective goal."
99,17923,F,"Although this image of chess pieces may seem like a strange representation of leadership, I believe that it exemplifies the underlooked characteristics of a good leader. Based on the image, we can decipher that the red pawn is the leader. Despite the difference in color, the isolated object is still a pawn, just like the other pieces on the board. A good leader acts like they are a part of the team (not better than everyone else) and have a position to uphold. They are there to support others, set the direction through clear communication, and adapt to changing environments. Moreover, they are willing to make sacrifices for their team, wether that means sacrificing more of their time/energy or even ego."
100,17922,F,"To me, leadership means lifting others up to increase group potential. In this image, true leadership is exemplified by the individual in the blue shirt holding out one hand to someone on a stair above them and reaching the other arm out to the person on a stair below them. Leaders do not always know how to do everything, but they are not afraid to seek help from others or to provide assistance to those who may need it. Through these actions, leaders encourage others to not only bring their individual strengths to group endeavors, but also step out of their comfort zones and learn from the strengths of their teammates. In doing so, they encourage the sharing of ideas and skills to create a product that is better than the result of individual work. In essence, leadership is the art of facilitating collaboration by communicating with others."
101,17917,F,"This image captures how leadership is not about the leader's own success. Rather, a leader's success is defined by how well they help their team succeed both individually and as a group. In the image, the hand of the leader is quite literally the ""bridge to success."" The hand allows the team to make forward progress, yet it does not dictate or micromanage exactly what they should be doing. Furthermore, the image portrays the team as a little unbalanced on their feet, although the hand steadies them and acts as the backbone of the team. This kind of relationship symbolizes how leadership also means helping others navigate challenges. At its core, the essence of leadership is about guiding others through different obstacles to achieve more than they could have individually.

102,17916,F,"To me, the essence of leadership refers to the qualities and characteristics that a leader possesses. The image I chose encapsulates the balance that is to be achieved when being or becoming a strong leader. Motivation, communication, and responsibility are among some of the essential components to the balance of leadership. These leadership competencies are fundamental, and while they help to more clearly define the essence of leadership, they do not provide a comprehensive definition of it. In order to be a good leader, other qualities such as humility, honesty and accountability are needed. Therefore, the concept of leadership is a broad one that cannot be reduced to several words or images, but it is instead up to one's personal views that the essence of leadership can be found."
103,17913,F,"I believe that leadership is all about allowing other people to discover their strengths and talents and empowering them to direct their energy to impact the world. Leader sees the unique qualities of each person and brings together diverse individuals who share core values and goals for mutual benefit, allowing them to learn from each other's experience and grow while collaborating on projects. Moreover, leadership implies actually leading people and navigating them in discovering their potential by inspiring them and setting a direction for development. Not only a leader should be a good example for the employees and people he leads, but he also should be empathetic and patient, and has to find an individual approach to every person to allow effective conflict resolution and the company's growth."
104,17912,F,"The essence of leadership heavily relies on one's ability to empower others through collaboration. A leader should bring together and facilitate the talents of others in order to achieve a particular goal or vision. In this picture, the person at the top of the mountain captures my vision of leadership because of how they hold up the person next to them, which, in turn, helps them all achieve their common goal of climbing the mountain. Leaders should be visionaries at the forefront of their team who help make the team's dream a tangible reality. Leadership involves utilizing teamwork and organizing others to accomplish a common goal."
105,17910,F,"Leadership is more than the ability to be in charge of things and does not have to be a quality of a person of power. I believe it is not difficult to find people demonstrating leadership in daily life as long as they have the ability to consider/include everyone and influence others. As shown in the image, the lady did not ignore the homeless man like many people in society do. She recognizes him despite his state. In addition, both the homeless man and those who could have seen this scene will gain respect for the lady. This admiration can influence both to treat others with the same kindness the lady did.  
 
"
106,17908,F,"The image above reflects my understanding of leadership because the woman leading the group appears to be engaging with all members of her team, reflecting on their input, and evaluating their advice towards making an informed decision. She makes people on her team feel as though they are valued and should offer their suggestions to improve the product or pitch, while maintaining structure so that the conversation can progress in a productive way. Lastly, the woman is a part of her team. She does not simply dictate orders to her subordinates. Rather, she participates in the projects with them, but does not allow that to hinder the distinction of her title as the group leader, thus avoiding any confusion from the lack of a point person to direct idea flow and ensure group cohesion."
107,17907,F,"This photo to me represents leadership in many ways. I imagine the team having a peaceful and respectful discussion where each idea is heard. Leadership to me is consideration and communication – which is depicted in this photo. Another reason I find this picture to represent leadership is that the dynamic of each person in the photo indicates a good leader. While people might only identify the woman in grey standing over the desk as a leader- and while I agree that she represents a leader, so do those who are sitting. One important aspect of leadership that I think often is forgotten is that being a leader is knowing that sometimes it is necessary to step back and provide ideas and intellectual contributions rather than facilitate the discussion."
108,17902,F,"Efficiency at achieving a common goal is what I value most in entrepreneurial structures. Therefore, excellence of leadership is achieved when each person in a group is assigned the task based on their best capabilities. To reinforce their personal creativity, skillset and ideas, people should have a chance to work on their own, with the complete responsibility to achieve a particular goal; while still being a part of the group. Only great leaders can balance this fine line between personalising work to get the best out of professionals and uniting them under the common goal of the venture.

109,17901,F,"I believe that this photo represents leadership due to the leader holding onto those behind him. With leadership, you cannot hold such power without collaborating with others. There is no man left behind. Though the idea of having a position such as this may seem like it is a one person job, active listening and taking other voices into consideration is what truly allows someone to become a leader. It takes time for someone to learn to prioritize the needs of a group entirely before the needs of themself. However, this task is achievable with communication. Conversation allows for growth, which then provides optimal results in goals created by a group of people. In order to lead, you must first understand the values and ideas of those around you."
110,17900,F,"Water takes the shape of the container in which it is kept. Similarly, leadership looks different in varying environments. Leadership is the ability to align varying perspectives and ideas to reach common goals. For example, water universally hydrates humans, plants, animals, and bacteria. Each of those organisms have unique ways of taking in water and surviving, but water independently sustains all of their different needs. Being a leader means showing adaptability as leaders react accordingly to circumstances that present distinct obstacles. Water takes its solid form as ice when temperatures are very cold and, conversely, reaches its gaseous form as vapor when temperatures are very hot. Each of the water bottles shown are completely filled, but the process of filling their contrasting shapes is individualized."
111,17899,F,"I believe leadership is bringing chaos to order. When Michael Berzatto leaves his dilapidated restaurant to his family in Hulu TV series “The Bear,” his brother Carmen has to be a leader. Coming as a chef from a world renowned restaurant, Carmen downgrades to his family’s local sandwich shop in Chicago. The obstacles are endless - from debt to family trauma. Although everything seems against Carmen initially, he stays consistent and leads his new team to create a fine dining experience with a clear goal of obtaining a Michelin star. With respect and patience, Carmen turns “The Original Beef” into “The Bear.” Carmen leads his - at first struggling - staff to become driven individuals in the kitchen. The key to his success is his obsession with excellence and patience with his community."
112,17840,F,"I think this image is representative of leadership because often times, leaders aren't at the forefront of their groups. Instead, an effective leader may have to sacrifice for the good of the group, or take on a less appealing role. When someone is leading their group toward an end goal, they must work to push their peers to their maximum capabilities, and to do so, they must work to fill gaps in knowledge or understanding. This image is also interesting because there are leaders at all levels—the one big leader is holding up the bridge for his team, yet there's another leader in red that's leading the charge across the bridge. Leaders can appear in many different forms, some more outspoken, others more reserved, but their collaboration is what makes their team thrive and succeed."
113,17839,F,"Leadership reflects on the ability to care enough about those around you in order to guide them into achieving a certain objective. It means being able to ensure that everyone is working as a collective, as opposed to getting the job done individually. In a greater sense, it can be characterized as the ability to unite a large audience because helping provide the platform where others can work alongside with each other helps get the job done much more effectively. In the picture, the leader is providing a helping hand to make sure that everyone is able to get across and work with each other to be able to arrive at the outcome together. I like to think leaders are part of a work family."
114,17838,F,"I chose this image of a mother duck with her ducklings to portray what reflects my understanding on the essence of leadership. From my perspective, being a leader isn't just about taking charge and guiding others, it encompasses encouragement, growth, and support as well. A good leader is able to not only pave a way in the right direction but help others thrive and motivate them along the way. A leader always accounts for others while maintaining their responsibility and organization. I feel that the mother duck in this photo captures this image of leadership as she guides her ducklings across the street and through the grass, ensuring they are all safe and are able to develop and prosper by her side until they are ready to tackle the world themselves."
115,17837,F,"The essence of leadership is centric around the will to spearhead a unique vision. In order to unite others in working toward a common goal, it is imperative that a feasible plan of action is presented by taking initiative. The image I chose is the painting  American Progress  by John Gast. In this painting, Columbia, the female embodiment of America, is depicted herding American settlers toward the west as a push for the Westward Expansion. Columbia appears to soar above the settlers as a symbol of knowledge and industrialization, with one hand clutching a book and the other laying out the poles of a new railway. In her wake follows settlers on horsebook and foot, trains, amongst other white settlers. As she literally paves the way on her westward travels, Columbia's initiative propels others to follow in her footsteps."
116,17831,F,"Leadership involves creating an environment where people aren't afraid to be themselves. A leader can ensure there's group motivation through acts of integrity and will power to establish a safe environment. This picture represents the essence of leadership because these are my old campers dancing my choreography. When I was a camp CIT, I was offered the position to create a dance for half of the camp. I envisioned many steps for this routine, but I wanted to hear their ideas too because it's their dance as much as it is mine. Through trial and error, we created a dance that encompassed several ideas that led us to victory. Every camper was able to step out of their comfort and have fun from the help of my leadership."
117,17830,F,"As strange as it may sound, I believe that a chair completely reflects what a leader should be. In my opinion a true leader provides a space for team members to come to them without hesitation. They are a safe space, but they are also firm in their position. A leader commands a room in a way that may not always be direct. While some leaders can do their jobs in a very overt way, some may choose to hear the ideas of others and lead everyone in a cohesive direction. A chair is a comfort too many almost inherently because it is firm in its position. A room almost looks incomplete without a chair. This is the essence of leadership."
118,17829,F,"Leadership can be found through a person’s actions, and how those actions impact the people and society around them. I have found that some of the most impactful actions I can take as a student is participating in community service, which not only leads others through example but is also able to contribute towards change for the greater community. This image accounts for the years I spent as a Piano Pals mentor, teaching underprivileged students how to play the piano. Mentoring young kids was one of the most rewarding experiences I had throughout my time in high school, and was able to teach me how guiding others— in areas including music—can capture the essence of leadership. "
119,17828,F,"Street lights are visible, dependable and act as guides to show us the best path forward. These are qualities I believe should be associated with leadership. 
 Here, someone has left their bicycle leaning against a street light. They have placed their trust in the street light to continuously support the weight of their bike. In turn, even when burdened, the street light stands firm. Like the street light, leaders should be both a source of confidence and provider of stability. 
 The street lamp would stay turned on even when no people were around. It is not performative; it is practical. Moreover, as an inanimate object, it is not corruptible. Those are ideals leaders should strive for to meet my definition of the essence of leadership."
120,17824,F,"Below is an image of Barack Obama meeting with a group of people in the streets and greeting them. This image encapsulates leadership because in order to be a good leader, you must engage with those you leave and show you care about them and their struggles. Leadership must be an act of compassion and engaging with individuals. You cannot close yourself off as a leader. You must show that you are open to listening with a smile. Attitude is extremely important for being a leader. People pick up on the energy that you have day day. Attitude affects how those around you respect and work with you. Obama's attitude uplifts the other citizens in this image. The same holds true for any sort of work environment."
121,17823,F,"While a leader may be portrayed as someone who is above others or simply gives instructions, this image demonstrates the values of selflessness and initiative that constitute an exemplary leader. In this image, you can see the leader bridging the gap between two steps for their followers. This metaphorical expression shows the willingness of the leader to sacrifice for the group's interest, which plays into the aforementioned values of initiative and selflessness. Often times being a leader is not a glamorous role, rather one that requires them to pick up work that others don't want to do or serve as the primary problem solver during challenging times. As with great respect comes great responsibility, well-loved leaders are valued for the commitment they demonstrate towards the team in all facets."
122,17820,F,"To me, the essence of leadership is implicitness. It is quiet yet impactful and subtle yet known. A leader is transformative when their values and goals are embedded in the people being led. To achieve such an idealistic schema, leadership must be accompanied by empathy, kindness, and most importantly, a sense of belonging, and as a result, one's leadership becomes desired rather than forced. It becomes understood rather than announced. 
 I chose a picture I took at the New York skyline last week when I visited. As a tourist, I found myself making a to-do list in my limited five days in New York. At the top of my list, without even questioning myself, with the utmost simplicity and ease, was visit the skyline. Reflecting back, I realise that this encapsulates quiet and implicit leadership. I felt a natural desire to visit the skyline, paid $70, and found hundreds of other tourists doing the same on a random Tuesday, and felt a sense of belonging as I got to see the famous skyline. I was led, in this case, by a norm once created hundreds of years ago by people who thought creating a skyline-viewing business was profitable. They made it easy, effortless, and necessary."
123,17817,F,"Leadership is very important in daily activities, especially when there are various aspects involved. Sometimes, having someone to guide you helps you achieve your goals faster. To me, it involves the sharing of ideas, and teamwork based on good communication and coordination skills. This can be paralleled to bees; in every bee colony, there is a ‘queen bee’ who unifies the colony and provides some sort of direction for the other bees to follow. The queen serves the team and provides stability to the colony. Further, the queen bee also looks out for the future of its colony (i.e through producing more queens) similar to leaders who strive to think about future prospects. Furthermore, the queen bee works together with other bees, showcasing how a leader is not a director giving commands, rather works hand in hand with others. "
124,17814,F,"This image reminded me of my relationship with my older family members. Being the youngest child in my entire family, I always looked up to my older brothers and cousins. At family gatherings, they would make sure not to exclude me from their ""big kid"" games, and they spoke to me as if I were one of them. I think the essence of leadership is something held subconsciously. My desire to be like them and follow their ways was not a result of their spoken demands; rather, it was because I loved the kind, caring, and considerate people they were. To me, the essence of leadership begins from a place of love and nurture. From there, those who hold these qualities inspire, rather than tell, others to follow."
125,17813,F,"Mycorrizhae, a symbiotic fungal root, latches onto plants and extends its roots to bring back nutrients and water more efficiently than the original roots of the plants. Similar to the Mycorrizhae, leaders extend their abilities to help others create a stronger and more effective system, along with further connecting the individuals they are working working with. Fungi are often overlooked as parts of ecosystems, but are nevertheless extremely crucial. Leaders can follow the same path, as one does not need to be the loudest in the room to be the most effective leader. Just like fungi and plant roots work together to keep the plant alive, leaders and followers must collaborate to fully enjoy the fruits of their labor."
126,17811,F,"The essence of leadership as I see it is the ability to unite a group of people towards a common vision. The uploaded photo is from my high school's DECA club kick off. This image depicts the essence of leadership as it shows how the leaders are able to bring students together for the purpose of learning about business through DECA. In fact, leadership is not only about being able to manage a group of people and to be a positive role model. The essence of leadership also relates to being an inspiration for others and motivating them towards achieving some common goal. Ultimately, the student leaders in the image brought together a large group of students and offered them a safe space to strive toward a common goal."
127,17810,F,"This picture I discovered in my camera roll not only captures the chaos of move-in day but epitomizes leadership. The bed and walls that look as if they are pleading for personalization initially caught my eye. However, upon further inspection, I noticed my mother, standing offside, taking pictures as my father and I aimlessly mill around. The work my mom does, from scheduling appointments to keeping our fridge stocked with my favorite foods in addition to her full-time job, often goes unnoticed. Just as she is in this image, my mom is always working in the milieu to ensure that I am successful. Taking on extraneous tasks to lighten everyone’s load and providing deft expertise, she is the kind of leader I strive to be."
128,17806,F,"I believe leading is not all about achieving the most. It requires action with the intention of not leaving anyone out in the team effort, and a commitment to act on the belief that everyone has a role to play. In an interview with Wharton Magazine, Zeti Aziz noted “ Leaders are those who pursue the goals for the collective good and not for their personal gain,”  and we are of one mind. A competent leader should have the capabilities to create an inclusive community, guide the people within the community and not just plainly give directions. In order to gain a team's trust and respect, a leader should be generous with the two elements themselves toward the members. Leading requires the essence of making people feel heard and belong."
129,17805,F,"This scene encapsulates leadership because of the teacher’s emotional expression and teaching style. As representatives or directors of groups, leaders must have empathy and compassion. Because they guide and make decisions for others, leaders must put themselves in their group members’ shoes, considering individuals’ circumstances in tandem with the community’s at large. This requires empathy, compassion, and rationality, symbolized by the teacher’s smile and demeanor. Just as important as these personality facets is a leader’s ability to instill skills and leadership in others. After holding his students’ hands through new concepts, the teacher pictured is encouraging his student to not only attack the problem on his own but also lead his peers in the process. A good leader helps their community grow able and independent. "
130,17803,F,"The essence of leadership is identifying a mission and guiding a team in accomplishing that goal. However, this can often be misinterpreted as overseeing others as a ""controller"" rather than being an active participant/facilitator. Below, the top image depicts a boss directing a team to do all the work while the bottom image shows a true leader guiding the team towards success. A leader must be at the forefront of the mission as a facilitator rather than solely a public figure. With the contributions of a motivated leader, the team is likely to accomplish the mission at a faster rate, exemplifying what it means to be a true leader. As for the picture below, the bottom (collaborative) team of four will undeniably succeed faster than the top (subservient) team of three. Effective leaders in the modern world - including CEOs and politicians - actively assist their teams rather than only command them. A leader is not a dictator; a leader is a goal-oriented facilitator."
131,17802,F,"To me, leadership is equal collaboration. A mark of a true leader is including everyone’s viewpoints and ideas in a final product instead of simply relying on their own vision. Ensuring that everyone's suggestions are represented makes for a successful team and a great leader. The image I chose (staff-force.com) shows a team where everyone is equally involved in the conversation. While the leader could explain their point, as seen below, the circle looks accepting of everyone’s ideas, as the leader seems to genuinely want everyone’s input. Moreover, everyone is on the same level here. The leader is not in a demarcated area just for them, like the head of the table. Everyone is sitting in a circle and ready to contribute. "
132,17801,F,"
 This image captures my understanding of leadership. It shows multiple hand of different colors/ ethnicities/races joining together in the middle. To me, it represents collaboration and diversity. I think that the essence of leadership is being able to take people across all walks of life and all different backgrounds, and finding a way to make a productive system with them. Leadership means identifying the strengths and weaknesses in a group of people, so that you can best decide how they can contribute to a joint effort. A good leader is able to do this so effectively, that a group of people who otherwise have nothing in common can create a well-oiled machine. To me, this image represents diversity and care in the workplace, which is always a priority in a good leader."
133,17799,F,"This image resembles leadership in multiple ways. To start off, the man in the front is showing leadership by pulling the other two people up the mountain. Leaders today need to be able to pick people up even if it means putting them on your shoulders to lead them to succeed. This can also be seen as reliability. Being able to convey this attitude as a leader will go a long with when striving for a goal in life. Another feature the man in front is conveying is determination and confidence. Determination can contribute to being an excellent role model as a leader. The attitude you display to others is the attitude others will enhance and bring to the table. In order to be an impactful leader, you must have the features displayed in this photograph oh the man pulling his two coworkers up the mountain."
134,17797,F,"A flower bouquet captures the essence of leadership. Each flower grows in different colors, shapes, and textures, just like every leader comes from different backgrounds, has different perspectives, and a wide range of opinions to bring to the table. If you water your own flower, you can grow independently from the rest, but it is the arrangement and union of different flowers that makes the bouquet so beautiful. Every single flower when grown properly, complements the rest in astounding ways, just like a diverse group of people can create amazing works when put together. If every leader takes care of their petals and isn't afraid to branch out while in the same pot, then one can influence the rest so that they all bloom magnificently."
135,17796,F,"The essence of leadership to me is when someone helps others reach their potential. I think a leader is someone who enables others to find their own path and guides and supports them to take it. Rather than enforcing their ideal of who a person should become, they give the other people space to decide this for themselves. This also means leaders grow their characters in the process, as shown by the picture of both people helping each other to climb the mountain. However, this does not mean unquestioning support, but can also include criticizing and probing into individuals' goals - there would be some combination of determination and flexibility involved in this."
136,17795,F,"A strong leader should be able to identify the vastly different skills each member brings to the team and utilize them in a way that maximizes productivity and results. They lead with a strong moral compass and command respect. 
 Optimus Prime is quite undoubtedly the quintessence of leadership. With his unwavering loyalty towards his group, ability to make split second decisions, and humble nature, he stands out as not only an insanely cool character, but also a strong leader. He effectively harnesses the individual strengths of each person in his group and unites them during times of crises. He is deeply rooted in his moral code and believes in compassion and freedom. The members of his team respect him for both his strength and admirable leadership traits."
137,17751,F,"Personally, I think of leadership as the action of not only guiding but also helping. Although leaders are here to organize groups. They also provide the essential support needed for the greater good. This picture symbolizes my view of leadership depicting a person leading and most importantly helping its fellow. We clearly see that he is directing and showing the path, but we can recognize that he is also providing assistance in order to reach the goal. Great leaders possess many important skills such as problem-solving and decision making, and also essential character traits such as compassion and empathy. Leadership is not only about showing the path, it is about helping each and everyone get to the destination safely. A true leader does not leave anyone behind.

138,17749,F,"Leadership is an essential skill used in various aspects of life. To me, a good leader is someone who knows how to unite individuals from diverse backgrounds. I believe that the image I have chosen perfectly captures the essence of leadership because it depicts a leader guiding the way for a team of unique, different individuals. Furthermore, a leader sets an exceptional example for others and helps their team work towards a common goal, often putting the interests of the team above their own. Similarly, the leader displayed in the image is not selfish. Rather, they appear to be putting their team first by overcoming obstacles, which is precisely what a good leader should do to help their followers succeed. "
139,17747,F,"Leadership is placing others ahead of oneself to guide them towards a common goal. The photograph showcases leadership as it presents the leader aiding their community by lifting the members up in order to reach their objective, the bulls eye. This photograph also presents an important aspect of being a leader, which is the importance of initiative. Initiative is shown as the leader holds a string attached to an arrow that leads to the center of the target. If it were not for the leader positioning the arrow and rope, the other team members would be incapable of crossing. Leaders must lay a foundation of resources for their group to utilize, selflessly permitting others to make use of the work and effort they have done."
140,17745,F,"I believe this picture captures the essence of leadership because being a leader cannot be done alone. In this picture, the leader is the one in charge of the direction of where they are going and is making the big decisions. However, without the other members who are rowing, the boat would never get to their destination. I think it is important to acknowledge that leadership means that you look out for your team and take charge but also continue to rely on them to get to the desired outcome. This also gives the leader a sense of humility which is crucial. In addition, the leader here directing the boat also has to communicate with the rowers in order to reach their destination. Open communication is essential when you are a leader because you have to take into consideration the needs, desires, and capabilities of the whole group. For example, the leader of the boat would need to take into consideration if the rowers need a break and adjust his plans accordingly. Therefore a leader who wants to be successful accepts open communication and input from those they are in charge of.

141,17740,F,"A boss tells others what to do; an effective leader creatively exploits a common motivation between the people they work with. Leadership isn't about being the most powerful, talented or well-liked in a room. Good leaders ask ""what can I give?"" and find a way to exchange for what they need on a large scale involving many parties. My drawing is simple: it shows an apple farmer and a wheat grower. They each have goods to offer and wish to enjoy their harvest. However, it takes a leader to bake an apple pie. Leadership is identifying motivations, having ingenuity to create a new product/solution, and finding a win-win situation to satisfy both farmers and also a greater population (the townspeople who may purchase the pie). Good leadership can inspire others and make tasks feel not laborious because followers innately want to accomplish them."
142,17738,F,"The duty of a leader is to provide guidance, direction, and mentorship on a difficult path where the objective is to accomplish a goal. The attached picture accurately depicts this, as the individuals are climbing a steep walkway while the leader is guiding the pack. The leader is also stretching to reach the flag, otherwise known as the end goal. Another significant part of this photo is that each individual is reaching out for their fellow team member. A specific title or role is often not necessary to be a leader; everyone can be a leader in their everyday lives. The individuals reaching out for each other's hands may also signify the importance of teamwork and collaboration in leadership: a leader cannot accomplish something themselves."
143,17735,F,"Finding the balance between Collaboration and Self-Sufficiency is what lies at the very heart of Leadership for me. 
 The image above is of Lal Bal Pal (Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Bipin Chandra Pal), a profoundly famous triumvirate of assertive nationalists in British India in the early 20th century. 
 They were prime advocates of the Swadeshi movement, which aimed at transforming India into a self-reliant and self-sufficient nation. This movement involved the boycott of all imported items and the use of Indian-made goods in 1907 during the anti-Partition agitation in Bengal. They set forth the idea of Swarajya - self-rule - changing the political landscape of India forever, and breathing a new life into the Independence movement. 
 The idea that these three gentlemen represent is specially distinctive. They mastered the art of collaborating with the British Government (within reason) whilst not letting their own flag down - championing the cause of a truly independent India. 
 Treading the line between compromise and unwavering relentless is a daunting task. The essence of Leadership, to me, is maintaining this equilibrium across all one does."
144,17734,F,"Though many people have their opinions about her, to me Kris Jenner is the epitome of a leader. One quality of a leader that I find is essential is how to make the most out of every situation. Kris Jenner has the unique ability to use bad press and rumors to further enrich her family. There is a saying that many people use: ""The devil works hard but Kris Jenner works harder."" Kris Jenner shows that a leader helps organize and put in the work, even if they aren't the ones in the limelight. Kris is always one step ahead of everyone and knows what to do in order to get what she needs. Though reality TV is not my thing, I do appreciate Kris for he"
145,17733,F,"This picture was taken by my coach of our Shuttle Hurdle Relay team nationals. It illustrates the essence of leadership because a good leader remembers that the focus is not just on what the  leader  can do for the team, but how the  team  can best be motivated to believe in and accomplish a common goal themselves. A team can't genuinely work well together if they don't trust or support one another to some extent. You can tell from the elation on our faces and how happy we are for each other that our coach prioritized cultivating a culture of support amongst ourselves. This is a sometimes overlooked role in being a leader but truly one of the most important to form a more deeply connected and motivated team."
146,17731,F,"I chose an image of me and the Taiwanese kids I worked with over a 2-week span teaching English! While guiding the class day to day in developing and executing our lesson plans is one form of leadership, I believe the essence of leadership lies in the community built by a leader. On the first day I met the kids, many were shy and even the outgoing ones were hindered by the language barrier, yet as we continued to work with them--gently prodding their interests and playing games--they began to open up and embrace us and each other. Our leadership brought out the best in the kids so we would be able to contribute and they would be able to take the most from our teachings."
147,17726,F,"In this image, you see two people maintaining an equilibrium. This is something a leader should strive to do. Each member of a group is a valuable asset and is deserving of treatment that makes them feel as such. Thus it is up to the leader to maintain a balance within the group between themselves and others. Whether it be adopting a multidisciplinary perspective or maintaining an open mind with constituents, a leader should always make the effort to put themselves at an equal level with others. This way, they can foster dialogue that is inclusive of all ideas, and promotes diversity in thought. It also prevents a sole perspective from dominating, and enables creativity to flourish. A leader should strive for balance among their team, and should take charge of enforcing it."
148,17724,F,"I believe the essence of leadership is the ability to communicate with others in order to bring together the strength in each individual. I recently watched  Oppenheimer , a movie directed by Christopher Nolan, and had a chance to think about the leadership required in a director. A movie director is in charge of many people, including the actors, scriptwriters, cinematographers, and more. Making a film can never be done by a single individual but a group of people with different roles and visions. In some situations, these differing perspectives may come in harmony, but in most times, they may clash. For instance, a scriptwriter might wish a certain progression of an act, but cinematographers might think they are challenging to be portrayed through camera. A director delegates these different roles to others but also constantly communicate between these individuals in order to find solutions that satisfy both individual and collective needs. Therefore, I think the image of Nolan's directing him film capture the essence of leadership."
149,17722,F,"When I think about the essence of leadership, I think about the difference between a boss and a leader. While these two job titles are commonly used interchangeably, the nuances between their roles distinguish truly effective and empowering leadership. Like the image shows, while a boss keeps their own business interests as top priority by managing their team from an authoritative position, a leader sees themselves as a member of their own team. Essential traits   of a good leader include being able to motivate and empathize with their team members, ultimately cultivating not only growth and results, but also a supportive community. By focusing on the journey of development rather than static results, effective leaders create a positive influence on their team thus inspiring dedication and growth.

150,17721,F,"I perceive leadership to be a guiding presence to a common goal, as seen in this photo. As a member of my high school’s lacrosse team, I experienced leadership firsthand in the actions of both my captains and my coach. Throughout the season, they dutifully represented their roles as leaders by supporting and encouraging our team towards state playoffs. In this photo, our team had trusted our coach by running a play we hadn’t yet used during a game, and it greatly paid off as we successfully scored. It was through leadership that our team trusted our coach’s judgement and ran a play we weren’t the most familiar with. Examples such as this photo confirm my idea of leadership to be a supportive role that benefits the entire community."
151,17716,F,"I chose an image of Captain America from the popular Marvel franchise to represent my understanding of leadership. In order to be a leader, you have to be confident in your own abilities even if it is difficult. This confidence, to me, is like that of a superhero; even though humans do not have supernatural abilities, sometimes you have to act like you do in order to be a good leader. People naturally follow those that appear to know what they are doing, and so those who are confident in their actions often make good leaders. Not everyone with confidence will make a good leader, of course, but all good leaders have confidence. For all of these reasons, I believe that this image of Captain America staring valiantly represents the unshakeable confidence necessary for leadership."
152,17715,F,"The essence of leadership is teamwork in both understanding and applying each other's strengths and weaknesses to combat problems together. A leader is not someone who sits on the throne, but rather is one who works with and helps the people. A leader understands their own weaknesses and learns to better themselves from the collaboration of their teammates. In the attached image, several business people are climbing up a mountain, with one person on top helping and encouraging the others. This image shows that the essence of leadership or rather the true meaning of a leader, is someone who directs their teammates to achieve a common goal rather than celebrating their own victory and helping themselves at the cost of others. Leaders are ambitious, confident, selfless, and patient."
153,17713,F,"To me, leadership is the ability of an individual to effectively guide a group of people to reach a goal. I think this image does a great job capturing that idea. In the front, we see someone leading the way for all of the people behind him. With every step they take together they reach a higher level. The dynamic amongst the people also demonstrates productive leadership. It is clear to see who is the leader, but it is hard to see a strong power dynamic. A good leader manages to stay humble and make their team feel just as important as the leader. Every team member shows leadership in a different way. Together, with the help of the leader, the collective reaches their goal."
154,17710,F,"My younger self equated leadership with a controlling attitude and an air of superiority. As a child, I figured that leaders were just bossy people—people who others didn't want to be around. My view has since changed. 
 In the image I found, the hand forms a bridge to guide other members of the community from one point to another. The hand doesn’t overshadow these individuals, nor does it shame them for not being able to cross alone. Rather, it encourages everyone to stick together and move forward towards a common point, all while uplifting and motivating each other. 
 A leader is someone who can help others become the best versions of themselves and unite like-minded individuals, and I think this image captures that essence.

155,17709,F,"When I think of a leader, the first person that comes to my mind is Lionel Andres Messi. Last December, he became without doubt the greatest football player in the history. He won the World Cup. The whole squad won the championship for him. 
 Argentina is an underdeveloped country where football (soccer) is one of the main sources of happiness, and with that importance comes an immense pressure and responsibility for their players. Leo Messi, carried the whole squad with him, scoring when the game got stuck, taking penalty kicks, assisting… but also by being an example of passion, grit, gratitude, hard work and talent for his teammates. That is what leadership means to me, being able to share an objective with your team, being the first to take responsibility and helping them through the journey."
156,17707,F,"In my mind, leadership is the ability and skill of individuals to help uplift and improve the work of the organization or team surrounding them. Here, the key point is that the leader is a part of the greater team—while they do possibly hold more power and influence, a crucial part of their role is about working with others from the ground up. As seen in the photo I chose, the leader not only uses skills such as communication or decision making to fulfill their executive role, but also actively functions as the foundation of the larger organization. Leadership is more than just calling the shots, but about holding accountability and trust from others, enabling the team as a whole to achieve greater success. "
157,17706,F,"From my perspective, the core of leadership is ensuring societal development, primarily to guarantee that each individual with any background has a fair chance of succeeding throughout their lives. Leadership may take distinct forms or shapes in academic, social, and business environments. Yet, this picture illustrates the prime interpretation of the word as I understand it. The teacher (or the leader) may not even be receiving adequate financial returns, but her actions portray character, strength, and social responsibility. Ultimately, she is fostering the next generation of leaders who will soon be able to escalate her actions as they form a new cycle of leadership.

158,17705,F,"I snapped this photo during the PENNacle pre-orientation program. It captures the essence of leadership, as I see it, because it features Deepak, one of our leaders, bringing us together. An exceptional leader can unite, guide, and inspire groups of people. One of the many times the leaders united us was during this campfire where we sang, connected, and took photographs to capture the incredible experience. Deepak guided us by leading songs, starting dances, and putting us together for photos while he also left room for us to explore the songs we wanted to sing and talk to who we wanted to interact with. He represents how a leader should be a present model and make room for others to feel comfortable to express themselves."
159,17702,F,"This image captures the essence of leadership in many ways. First off, the person holding the rope is helping others reach their goals. Secondly, the person in the front is courageous enough to be first and pave the way for the others. Lastly, the person facing backward is supporting and guiding another person who seems like they might need some assistance. This image highlights the different forms of leadership rather than just one traditional role/trait. A fundamental part of leadership is versatility and having various roles in order to continually progress as a group. As I explained, being helpful, brave, and supportive are all traits of a leader. Ranging strengths within a group is beneficial to the overall goal since people are bringing widely different skills to the table."
160,18239,M,"Leadership is standing out from the crowd in order to do what is right. It can be shown in many different ways- some being verbal, or some being through actions themselves. In some rare instances, it can be shown through both. This is why I feel that the picture I chose truly captures the essence of leadership as a whole. Martin Luther King Jr not only led through his speeches, but through action as well. Although Martin Luther King Jr faced severe backlash for his protests regarding freedom for black people, he continued to lead by example and break the cycle of racism built up in America. He sacrificed his life for the slight chance that the world could someday become a better place. His influence on the minority groups in America characterize a true leader."
161,18238,M,"This picture simply shows a large pack of wolves making their way through the snow in a single file line. It is believed that the weakest and oldest are in the head of the line followed by younger members. Finally, in the very back of the pack is the strongest leader. The leader’s job is to make sure everyone stays in line and on course. This picture also emphasizes that a leader must know how to follow. The last wolf was once in the middle of the pack, but as it learned the ways of life and physically grew stronger, more responsibility was placed upon it. Eventually, the wolf will grow old and weak and will have to depend on younger wolves to help it through the migrations. 
"
162,18235,M,"For me, leadership, in its purest form, is a hierarchical understanding of social order. In said paradigm, leadership is a logical extension of basic group function. A world in which one leads necessarily manufactures one in which others follow; for this reason, the essence of leadership to me is a triangle — wherein succeeding discrete layers “support” ever narrower iterations of things. In this paradigm, it is the non-symmetrical geometry that defines the relationship between the leaders and the followers. I believe the essence of leadership is defined by how it relates people/etc. to each other. This stratified stature is, in essence, what leadership can be abstracted to, and thereby defined by. 
   
"
163,18234,M,"I've attached a photo from the Tiananmen Square incident in China 1989. I believe this photo captures the essence of leadership since it shows standing for the values you are fighting for no matter how great the challenge is ahead. The photo shows a man alone with just a bag as he stands in front of a series of tanks. This man, through the action of going against the government in protest, put his life in danger even when he was alone with no real supplies to combat the government. Yet he used what he had (his body) to stand in the way of the tanks and stop them (even if only momentarily) to fight for his cause and what he believed in. Using all you have (even when it isn't that much) in the face of immense challenge is the essence of leadership."
164,18232,M,"I have chosen this image of Jon Snow as an example of leadership because it shows him charging into battle by himself even though he is fully aware of the consequences of his actions. This shows leadership as leaders are typically known to lead from the front and that is exactly what Jon Snow is doing in this picture. Furthermore, he is not seen running away from the soldiers and horses as they charge at him. Instead, he stands his ground in front of his soldiers who are standing behind him which shows courage and bravery. These qualities are also seen in a great leader. Throughout the show, Jon is consistently seen as showing leadership qualities, but this picture fully encapsulates the leader that he is."
165,18231,M,"The image I have selected is an ancient religious painting depicting Jesus Christ washing the feet of his disciples as described in John 13:1-15. In my opinion, the essence of leadership revolves around servitude. The subject of the icon is Christ, towel in hand, washing and drying the feet of his disciples; his posture is that of submission to his followers. By placing himself in the humble position of a servant, Christ demonstrates to his followers the humble character of a leader, one who can lower himself even to the position of a servant for the benefit of those around him. In a nutshell: nobody is beneath you, and in demonstrating your care for your group you can effectively lead and support them."
166,18228,M,"To me, the compass captures the essence of leadership.  
   
 Firstly, to lead is to have a clear direction and conviction on where the team ought to be headed. Just like how a compass indicates true north, a leader should be able to steer the group in the direction of a common goal. While the leader need not necessarily dictate the direction, he or she should be someone in which the rest of the team can look to for sound judgement, reconciliation of differences and guidance. 
   
 The compass also serves as a metaphor for the “moral compass”. A good leader should be firmly grounded in his values, which should be clearly communicated to, and understood by, the rest of the team. A clear set of values would then ripple into every decision made, whether it is balancing between being goal-oriented and people-oriented, resolving a dilemma or responding to a crisis. I believe that only with a demonstrated consistency in values and principles can a leader truly receive buy-in from the rest of the team.

167,18224,M,"The essence of leadership is best seen as the non obligated taking of action to lead individuals with a common set of ideas or goals. The image I have chosen is titled, ""Obama Returns to Berlin, Scene of Iconic 2008 Speech"". This image best captures the essence of leadership because we see, a younger version of, Obama, an influential figure fuel the crowd in Berlin with ideas or goals that he himself best sees fit. Given that Obama is in Germany, it is important to see how many people turn out to listen to what he has to say. However, it is not only his drive and passion to lead, but also his guidance for individuals to find leadership within themselves too. For this reason, this image best captures the scenery and ideals of what a leader is to me."
168,18223,M,"Solutionitis is the idea that in order to find the best solution to an issue, a leader patiently consolidates all avenues and perspectives rather than jumping straight to a solution. As by doing so, the solution would be marred by their personal biases and dogmas. My photo, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi moonlighting as a driver himself to learn the drivers experience, is synonymous with the idea. By gaining this new-found perspective, avoiding solutionitis, he uncovered new issues within the company that he wouldn't have found before. 
   
 Thus, ultimately, the essence of leadership, in my opinion, is dispelling all of one's pre-conceived notions and biases towards an issue and really embracing a perpetual cycle of taking in perspectives, unlearning and relearning. Creating a collaborative environment conducive to everyone's perspectives being comfortably shared."
169,18222,M,"A leader possesses unique traits in which allows them to discover direction, and bring people together, to believe in that direction, and follow them. Confidence to stand out, sometimes alone, changing the status quo, developing their vision. Courage, to go against others ideas, and make the difficult decisions that effect others. Compassion, to listen and acknowledge the necessities of the others around them. The image below captures the essence of leaderships because we see a woman standing out, a different color then the others, and leading the ones behind. With a clear vision for a particular direction, and the ability to have others follow. She has the bravery to make the final decision, of which direction to go, and the bonds and element of trust for others to go in that same direction.

170,18219,M,"This image of my choosing not only reflects the essence of leadership, but emphasizes the importance of accountability. For background, this image is in the midst of a critical in conference match up between UCLA and Oregon. The big man for UCLA just made a mistake in overtime while down by two points. In this scenario as a teammate, it'd be easy to just blame him and give up. Instead, the point guard picks his head up after the big man hangs it low and tells him he's okay and to move on to the next play. This reflects leadership because it portrays an understanding of the bigger picture and the ultimate goal and the correct way to achieve that, not only by yourself, but with your team as well."
171,18216,M,"Leadership is about uplifting others, helping others rise with your help. In pursuit of a noble and common goal, leaders are there to understand the people they help. Leaders care and are not bosses. They exist to make a team shine and function, to highlight people's strengths and to plan accordingly to mitigate people's weaknesses. When I think of a leader, I think of someone exactly like the photo. I think of someone who is leading by example, being the first in charge during battle. A leader is someone who is undaunted by a challenge and pulls the rope. A leader helps uplift people from all backgrounds through the power of negotiation and compromise. A leader helps their people even when scaling above the clouds, even when scaling an upwards hill."
172,18215,M,"A leader is evaluated by his ability to pave the way for his team. This includes establishing teamwork, cooperation, efficiency, productivity amongst many essential values within the group. In other words, a good leader always has a positive impact on his team. Following this line of thought, I have picked the attached picture. 
 Further, the leader need not be the most talented or gifted individual on the team. Instead he/she is the one who makes the team tick. By binding a group of individuals into a team, the leader ensures the members of his team perform to their full potential under his guidance. Therefore, in my opinion, leadership is marked by an overall positive impact on the team. On the other hand, undertaking the responsibilities of leadership should also have a positive effect on the leader, demonstrating that he/she is fit to be a leader"
173,18214,M,"I believe that Julius Caesar embodies the key principles of leadership. Renowned for his role as commander and as ruler of the Romans, Caesar's reputation was built of two key ideas: communication, charisma. 
 Julius was an author and a statesman, meaning he had a strong vocabulary and a powerful voice. Often we would address his soldiers directly, speak clearly, and was known to use convincing language in the senate. The ability to communicate with those around you and leave very little ambiguity in your words is an essential part of being a leader. Caesar was also known to be charismatic, or even ""down to earth"". Meaning that he would often socialize and live among his soldiers without regard of their rank or social status. This made Caesar very popular among his people for not pushing them aside and simply barking orders. Being pleasant to those around you makes it much easier to work as a team and achieve goals. 
 Together these two characteristics are the foundations of leadership."
174,18213,M,"The image I have selected for the example of leadership is my Head Coach for wrestling Roger Reina. He portrays leadership by leading by example. Coach Reina every year sets a goal to climb a mountain to represent our team culture of faith over fear, full effort, struggle well, and serving others. On his journey, he illustrated grit and determination by not giving up when challenges were thrown his way. When Coach Reina reached the top of the 21,125ft mountain, he waved a flag that said Penn Wrestling to show us that our team culture can help us achieve our goals and reach the top of “our” mountain. Coach Reina is a role model for me because he not only speaks his values but shows them in his actions everyday as well."
175,18212,M,"This image is of a group of sled dogs that are all working for the common goal of taking the sled and its rider to a specified location. Featured mainly in this image are the two dogs at the front of the pack, making up the first row of many. These dogs at the front demonstrate the essence of leadership as they are responsible for directing the entire sled group, and they are also the first ones to step into new territory. The other dogs in the pack trust the two dogs at the front just as how the individuals that a leader is working should be able to trust the leader. This image also does a good job modeling that a leader also would not be very effective without its team."
176,18209,M,"The essence of leadership is when a person can communicate and rally a group of people, regardless of scale. From a leader in a group project to a President, leadership is displayed by those who can facilitate and help bring others forward in uncomfortable situations. A leader has to be bold, not necessarily the loudest, but someone who can get their message across to others, thus encouraging them. Confidence must always be shown, even when the leader themself has their own doubts. A leader must also be reliable; when people rely on you, you must bring forth what the people want. Most of all, a leader must care. This means the leader must prioritize their role and embrace the sacrifice that comes with the role. A leader must trudge through adversity if it means losing sleep, suffering, and being uncomfortable overall."
177,18207,M,"I chose to use this photograph because I think the essence of leadership can best be captured by leading by example. In the picture, the individual is striving towards success and winning. Natural leaders are also natural winners. When people see someone succeeding, they will follow them to the ends of the earth. Leaders set an example for everyone to follow. The example is what people will strive to do. The better the example, the more likely the followers will succeed in that area. This example also works in a negative aspect. If a leader is slacking off or not doing their job, others will follow and then no one will succeed. The output of the group is dependent on the leader's course of action: whether they will work to succeed or fail in the process."
178,18206,M,"To me, this image represents leadership because it projects a leader as a facilitator rather than an orderer. Being a successful leader means one has successfully prepared their peers to be leaders themselves. In other words, you give them the direction to accomplish their pursuits. Consequently, you have created a team that gets work done and can run itself more efficiently. The picture shows that the “leader” is the hand, and the “team” is the four individuals struggling to get across the ravine. Rather than the hand leaving the four on their own to find a path across, it is offering itself to help them accomplish the goal. Therefore, aiding them to one day become leaders themselves—the image of what leadership is to me. "
179,18204,M,"Leadership is much more than simply having the loudest voice in the room, or walking at the front of the line. Leadership is an image, an example of the dedication, tenacity, and grit required to achieve the common goal among the followers. It is a leaders job to inspire passion that drives one beyond all reasonable thought, before they throw in the towel and give up. It is this definition that the image from Hacksaw Ridge embodies. The man is Sergeant Howell and he has been severely injured on the field of battle, however he continues to maintain his calm and push Private Doss to save others before himself. It is by maintaining this image that he further inspires the passion within Doss to continue his selfless work. Even when the Sergeant should be screaming and begging for help, he still puts the men under his command before himself. This sort of unwavering ability to maintain values is what makes this the perfect example of leadership."
180,18201,M,"As captain of the Portuguese team, Cristiano Ronaldo was injured and sidelined during the finals of the Euros, which ended up going to penalties to decide the championship. When an extra player was required to shoot to break a tie, the team instinctively turned to Ronaldo to make a decision. Immediately, Ronaldo nominated his teammate Joao Moutinho to take the kick, praising his skill, motivating him, and inspiring him to step up despite a lack of confidence. Moutinho’s penalty ended up winning Portugal the championship. Ronaldo demonstrates pure leadership as his teammates naturally rely on him during critical moments, and he is able to motivate his teammates to play above their level. Ronaldo demonstrates that leadership is primarily demonstrated through commanding the respect and trust of others, and knowing them well enough to bring out the best in them."
181,18199,M,"I think that this picture showcases what leadership should be and how leadership should be done. In this photo, there are two situations that are trying to result in the same goal. In the picture above, it showcases a person who believes they are a leader, just supervising everything and ordering people to do the work and just telling them what to do. In the below picture, it showcases a person in the same leadership position, but the person assumes leadership responsibilities, like showing how to do the task at hand and setting an example of how to properly lead. The two different scenarios clearly shows what a leader should do and what a leader shouldn't do, as well as showcasing examples of what should be expected of a good leader."
182,18196,M,"For my image, I chose Lebron James as he is someone who encompasses the essence of leadership. Lebron leads in various ways. For one, he leads by example, always giving his all for his team. His strong work ethic and obsession for excellence that has led to his unparalleled longevity in the sport inspires his teammates to also work their hardest towards the goal of winning championships. This leadership by example is also displayed off the court. He is a role model for young men everywhere as he is someone who cares a lot for his family and gives back to his community. Additionally, he is extremely vocal on the court which coincides with the traditional perception of a leader. He is constantly communicating with his teammates to organize them into a cohesive unit. Overall, Lebron James epitomizes leadership in its various forms."
183,18195,M,"Leadership is the act of doing what needs to be done to achieve the desired goal regardless of fame and notoriety. People can be forgotten because they’re not presenting the final product but there are steps needed to get to the desired outcome. This is a picture of Donna from the show “Suits.” She was one of the receptionists for Pearson Specter, a powerful law firm in New York City. Even though the show was mainly based on the pursuits of the lawyers, the series often showed the lawyers stressed about a problem then asking Donna about it and feeling relieved because she already solved it. Donna is just one of many receptionist who help run many businesses but are often overlooked. This is leadership. "
184,18194,M,"This picture shows not only a person leading others and offering guidance but also a leader who remains united and connected with their team. In the picture, the man in front is even looking back on the group, presumably ensuring their safety and progress. I chose this picture because a leader is someone who guides and empowers others while recognizing that the importance should be placed on the entire group, not the individual leader themself. True leadership is using your expertise, knowledge, and power to help guide others, not draw attention to yourself or flaunt your capabilities. Leadership comes in very many forms, but no matter the form, it is critical to emphasize that the leader is there for the people they lead, and not themselves."
185,18191,M,"I've selected a playful depiction of Teddy Roosevelt that's tied to his iconic quote, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick."" This choice isn't an endorsement of force in leadership but a nod to the underlying philosophy. Today's media often showcases leaders as loud, charismatic figures who dominate every space they inhabit. While this is one shade of leadership, in my eyes, impactful leaders, who've cultivated genuine respect, don't have to shout to be heard. The ladder part of the quote also hints at how leaders must be competent themselves to earn the respect of their team. Their true strength lies in the depth of their convictions and the sincerity of their deeds. Such leaders communicate with a silent power, where the essence of their message, and not its volume, drives people to listen."
186,18155,M,"The image I chose represents the necessary ability of leaders to guide and direct a team towards a goal. The man with the binoculars in the image has his sights set on a goal, one that the team’s individual team members cannot see or cannot focus on. The other people on the boat trust the leader to direct their efforts towards accomplishing the goal of the team, thus they are able to place all of their attention towards doing their job as effectively as possible. If the leader has not fostered a sense of trust and camaraderie in the group, the goal will not be accomplished productively. The people on the boat would be clamoring to take the binoculars from the man at the front to confirm their current heading is correct."
187,18152,M,"Leadership is about maximizing the potential of groups -- which inherently consist of people with differing skills, backgrounds, and experiences -- while also developing group members as individuals. A person is a true leader if they can assemble a product from their group that exceeds the sum of their group's parts while empowering and guiding the people they serve toward a socially beneficial outcome. A knife used to make a PB&J sandwich is an object that exemplifies these criteria. The knife generates synergy by combining a sweet condiment with a savory one, resulting in an affordable, filling snack that millions of people enjoy daily. Without a knife, peanut butter and jelly are merely condiments. Only when they are spread together on bread do they become useful and impactful to society."
188,18151,M,"Captain America is an excellent example of the essence of leadership for several reasons. First and foremost, he is always willing to make personal sacrifice for the benefit of the rest of his team, such as when he jumped on a, what he thought to be live, grenade in order to save the rest of his squad. Sacrifice in some form or another is often a quality indicative of great leaders, as it shows true commitment to one's cause. Furthermore, he holds his values of honesty, integrity, and respect in very high regard, and all of these are imperative to being a great leader. His qualities clearly illustrate that he is the essence of leadership, but the way others (the Avengers and citizens alike) look up to him also demonstrates that he is a real leader. In this specific image, he is leading an army into a battle, representing his willingness for sacrifice, respect for his comrades, and the respect his comrades have for him."
189,18143,M,"As an avowed fan of ancient history, I chose a photo of Cincinatus, the famed Roman leader who was summoned out of retirement from his humble farm to save Rome from invaders. Granted full control over the state, he swiftly defeated the enemy, and at the height of his glory returned to his farm to let the politicians resume their work. Cincinnatus was a unique Roman leader as a man of integrity who got the job done. Having led the front lines of the infantry, his selfless devotion to the state made him a symbol of Roman virtue. He understood the sense of duty and in stepping down from his position, despite his immense fame, he set an example by respecting the power granted to him by the people."
190,18139,M,"Leadership is a collaborative spirit where a person can unite a diverse group of people around a common goal. It incorporates a subtle and nuanced balance between unified vision and diverse perspectives. A leader should be able to coordinate multiple team members by recognizing the strengths and abilities of each individual. I chose this image because I personally believe that leadership should emphasize horizontal collaboration, as opposed to a top-down hierarchy. In this photo, the pawns are standing side-by-side to each other, yet one of them produces the shadow of a king. Leadership is not necessarily a position or title, but the ability to lead others and to progress forwards as a team. I believe that true leadership -- the type that facilitates innovation and creativity -- must avoid the rigid systems of bureaucracy in typical corporations. I would draw a strong contrast between managing a team (focused on achieving short term results and productivity) and leading a team (focused on implementing long term visions that have radical impacts)."
191,18138,M,"Late King Hussein of Jordan ascended the throne at 17 years of age; thus, exemplifying the essence of leadership. This photo is influential as it portrays King Hussein's early rise to power despite his youth. King Hussein demonstrated exemplary resilience, determination, and will-power as he navigated the complexities of leading a country experiencing various pressures in a region (Middle East) undergoing significant economic and political challenges. In addition, this image encapsulates King Hussein's leadership by highlighting his ability to engage with local ministers and military leaders; thus, exuding an air of respect and authority even at a young age. All in all, this photo of young King Hussein truly reflects the essence of leadership as it showcases him leading a country in the face of adversity."
192,18137,M,"I believe that a leader's main role is to contribute to the growth and well-being of those they are leading. This photo represents how the leader is not the person who shows everyone the way and reaches the goal first. Instead, a leader is one who listens to their coworkers' ideas and propels them forward by supporting their growth in all ways possible. Here, we see the leader being the bigger person - one who has the capacity to lend their hand to those they are leading. In essence, a leader is not simply instructing people to do as they are told but is helping build a pathway that can guide them on their own independent journey. In my idea of a leader, a leader also works arduously to combine the resources at hand to optimise attaining their team's goal."
193,18136,M,"Though this is an imperfect image, I think much of leadership can be described by the image of dominoes. In a row of dominoes, the leading domino is also the last domino. Just as it is responsible for keeping the rest of the dominoes up, it bears the heaviest burden when the dominoes fall—even when it is not the reason why the dominoes collapse. 
 Leaders should strive to do the same. Though they may find themselves in top positions, they should take on the most difficult of tasks, bear the greatest responsibilities, and be okay with being at the bottom—not taking credit for their actions even when playing the most important of roles. 
 Though most definitions of leadership place leaders at the center or at the top of a group, the reality is that leadership often exists outside of leadership positions, for the true leader of a group is not necessarily the individual with the highest position but rather the one working the hardest, setting the greatest example, and stepping up when help is needed the most."
194,18134,M,"In a time where everything we do gets recorded we forget there was a time where that was not the case. An aspect of leadership to me is those who right and record whether it be the result of a battle, the sale of an item or the ideas of an intellectual. Scribes and writers are leaders of their respective futures by communicating their present and preventing ideas from being forgotten. Although they themselves may not be leading while in the act of writing, in their own way they influence, they give examples and they provide a backbone for history and knowledge.

195,18133,M,"This photo of geese flying in a 'V' shape represents the essence of leadership for three main reasons. First, the goose at the tip of the 'V' leads the flock in the direction they need to go. The rest of the geese drop into formation as a result of the lead goose's position. Second, the lead goose leads by example by doing the most work. This first goose has to break the wind for the other geese, which is significantly harder than just flying back in the flock. This leader sets the tone for the rest of the flock. Finally, the lead goose does his job not for his own personal gain, but instead for the overall betterment of the flock. This combination of leadership seen in the lead goose captures the essence of what it means to be a leader."
196,18132,M,"The image that comes to mind when I think of leadership is the painting of Napoleon’s return from Elba. For context, Napoleon just suffered two humiliating defeats from the European coalition against him, forced to abdicate the throne, and was exiled to the small island of Elba after the French people turned their backs on him. Instead of pitying himself, he escaped from the island, and decided to create an army of his own to fight off Frances’s enemies. Even though he was practically hated by his own people, he still managed to rally an army of 300,000 Frenchmen with just his confidence, oratory skills, and leadership abilities. This goes to show how leadership can be exuded anywhere, even in the worst scenarios, as long as the leader can rally people around a common cause."
197,18131,M,"To me, the fireside chats during the Great Depression and World War II by FDR capture the essence of leadership at its finest. At one of America and the world's lowest points, FDR used his voice to guide and assure his citizens through the dark period. Evident by his 12 years in office, the longest tenured President in American history kept his people informed and up to speed, maintaining trust and their favor. This picture in particular is very reminiscent of press conferences Presidents still attend today. However, he is sitting, showing how comforting and informational he intended his chats to be. There was no political motive, only a leader trying his best to guide his people. And it's the kind of leadership I look for in those above or around me."
198,18129,M,"I chose this image because it demonstrates the importance of clear communication. It is integral for leaders to clearly communicate to others the tasks that they must complete, as if there is confusion then it can ruin the whole project. Many projects need all parts to be completed correctly for them to be successful, and it is impossible to do every part the right way if people do not even know what they are supposed to be doing. As a result, it is paramount for leaders to make sure that the people that they are trusting to assist them in tasks know what is required of them. This way, the workers will be confident in the work that they are completing, leading to successful projects."
199,18128,M,"A track baton is a perfect image of leadership. Leadership is something that should be carried confidently and with purpose. Good leaders have a direction, community, and transition. Having smooth transitions while passing batons from one teammate to another are important because it makes the team’s time faster. It is important to have good chemistry and community between each teammate so that exchange of the baton can be smooth. None of this can be done without proper direction or purpose on the track. Everyone’s goal is to continue the longitudinal movement of the race and ease closer and closer to the finish line. Leadership is the same. Good leadership takes strong possession of each of these skills and more. However, most importantly, I believe there is no one perfect way to be a leader. There are ways to explain common traits that good leaders have, but every leader demonstrates these traits differently. "
200,18126,M,"Being raised on the coast of Maine, I have always seen lighthouses encapsulating many aspects of the essence of leadership. No matter the circumstances around them, rain or shine, they demonstrate resilience and provide a clear vision for those seeking help around them. Furthermore, effective leaders prioritize the well-being of their team members before their own—analogous to how lighthouses serve to safeguard ships and their crews. They don't seek recognition for their service and focus on the greater good of those around them. The last key aspect of the essence of leadership in my opinion is to create a calming, though confident influence on the group one's leading by navigating challenges with composure, just as lighthouses emanate a reassuring presence in the midst of turbulent waters."
201,18125,M,"Leadership is deeply rooted in action. The most effective leaders are those who can lead by example: essentially making them one with their team. Not only does this set a precedent for the team on how the work needs to be done, but it also brings the leader close with his or her team, as each individual feels further connected with each other and their leader. Essentially, it all boils down to the fact that people enjoy having something in common with others, whether that be a joint goal or a shared struggle, a team wants to be able to relate to its leader. A leader must be the head of their team, not the commanding end. Leaders must also be at the same level as their subordinates in order to ensure that there is no one falling behind. A team is only as strong as its weakest link."
202,18122,M,"The image I chose depicts a person leading a team by setting a positive example. Leaders are supposed to inspire and not command their employees to engage in a task. This way, they can spark intrinsic motivation in their employees, which lasts longer and is more resilient to adverse outcomes than extrinsic motivation (e.g., money, ""fancy"" titles). A great leader conveys a sense of purpose to his subordinates and knows his team's work well. He thus normally chooses to acquaint himself with everyday business tasks and routines. Working next to his subordinates gives him a realistic view of the working environment and potential for improvement. Furthermore, he avoids excessive middle management, who might be tempted to hide problems to please upper-level management.

203,18116,M,"The essence of my leadership has trust as the foundation or the base of a structure. I believe being able to completely trust each other and being able to trust each other to the fullest and having the ability to lean on your teammates is essential. I believe that leadership operates as a structure, almost like a team. As soon as weak links are present within the whole structure, especially the integral ones, the process of everything breaking down starts. Personally, I have seen and been aspired by those who lead a group with complete trust and honesty in the group. It was definitely a wake up call for me and a change I wanted to make within my own leadership and qualities."
204,18113,M,"I think there's two core characteristics that define leadership.  
 First, it's uplifting those around you. This picture is from Suits where Brian, the character whose office is shown, is the least efficient lawyer at the firm. Still, he has such a positive influence on those around him, increasing their productivity greatly. Leadership isn't about being the best individually, but rather making the team as a whole best (through whichever role is required).  
 Secondly, it's about understanding what makes your team tick. In the picture I posted, Donna (woman on right) is really good at understanding people. Katrina (left) is a believer in quantitative measures of how effective a lawyer is and thus believes Brian should be fired. Donna helps her understand Brian's value to the firm, connecting with her on a personal level. Understanding how to motivate and connect with your team on a personal level is central to leadership."
205,18112,M,"This image of the Brita Filter captures the essence of leadership because true leaders always find the good in the bad. Just like a filter, they find unique ways to deal with the bad things that occur to turn them into good situations. Good leaders are those who are optimistic and charismatic to their employees and customers. For example, a restaurant may have a bad experience with a customer who complained about their food. Instead of reacting to the symptom, a true leader would respond to the root of the cause. They may have a conversation with the chefs, or even turn this event into a learning experience for the employees to know how to deal with bad customers. Thus, a Brita Filter captures the essence of how leaders see through the bad in situations to see the good that can result. "
206,18111,M,"This is an image of the art piece titled ""Liberty Leading the People"" by Delacroix. This was a piece that I studied in my Art History course in high school, and I loved the idea surrounding it. You can see the lady in the middle leading a group of people against the current reigning monarch in France. In the middle, you can see the lady carrying the flag of revolution and leading the way towards the liberation of the lower class in France. She is the personification of Liberty. You can also see a young boy to her right holding 2 pistols, representing sacrifice for the revolution. This image truly embodies leadership as she passionately paves the way for the citizens to revolt against an unjust government."
207,18109,M,"Leadership to me embodies the lighthouse metaphor. In my view, it's a beacon that guides and empowers, standing strong amidst uncertainty just as the picture shows one of the stick figures reaching out to someone on a shaky platform. Like a lighthouse, a leaders can offer a sense of direction, clarity, and stability to those navigating the turbulent waters of change. Their light symbolizes inspiration, illuminating opportunities and showing the way forward. Going back to the metaphor, Just as a lighthouse serves sailors, leaders serve their teams, providing unwavering support even in challenging times. The puzzle can also capture the essence of leadership as it shows different people having different personalities and styles and when everyone comes together and the puzzle is completed is where the bigger picture appears."
208,18104,M,"The school clock read 3:00 AM. I stared down the hallway to see it half-finished. In 4 hours, thousands of students would fill these hallways in anticipation of the best week of the year, DWDW, and we were nowhere near ready. 
   
 After pouring my soul into my work, I felt betrayed. Painting or cleaning wasn’t my “role”. Why was I being dragged down? As these thoughts drifted through my mind, the guilt flushed me red. DWDW is supposed to be about fostering an atmosphere of community. Instead, I was blaming the people I considered my family.  
   
 I grabbed a rag knelt down to scrub the paint off the floor. True leadership came not from the spotlight, but from doing what is necessary. 
"
209,18103,M,"Some of us believe that a good leader has to be powerful. In the past, many of our most memorable business leaders have been the ones who were strong, independent and rude. If your boss said something, you had to listen and learn. However, I actually think it should be the total opposite. 
   
 When I think of the word good leader, I see a person who knows how to listen. Business is about doing things as a team: we have to be able to work together, be innovative, and grow on a daily basis. A good leader is the one who knows how to make a working environment where the employees are able to speak without having to worry about getting mocked or laughed at. A good leader is the one who knows how to get everyone on board and participate. 
   
 In business, teamwork is the key. When a team works well together, the role of the leader becomes less important, and I think that is a good thing."
210,18102,M,"My definition of leadership is something like: modeling (setting an example), and motivating others to act upon, the goals and principles of a group or team. Ultimately, it means being consistently being a great teammate/coworker/boss/friend while influencing others to be equally great. However, as depicted in the image, I believe that high-level leaders don't just accept general competence or 'great work'. Instead they set ambitious standards and expectations to push others to take things to the next level. Through their own actions and communication towards coworkers, they show them 'the way' towards unforeseen new heights, or, as shown in the picture, that ""next step"".  Through their own actions and communication towards coworkers, they show them 'the way' towards unforeseen new heights, or, as shown in the picture, that ""next step""."
211,18099,M,"I chose an image of a pilot in the cockpit of the Space Shuttle because it highlights both the responsibilities and opportunities that leadership manifests. Leadership means keeping an eye on many dials, only pressing buttons and making decisions when needed. However, it most importantly emphasizes the importance of taking great care of your team and each individual person on it, no matter their proximity from you. It is only through collaboration, communication, and trust that you and your team are able to reach places beyond what should even be possible, beyond the scope of what was once inconceivable. Great leadership enables the whole to be greater than the sum of its parts."
212,18041,M,"I chose this picture because it displays leadership as a culmination of mutual respect for one another. The manager (Pep Guardiola), in the middle of the picture wearing black, relays his instructions for his players, wearing light blue, to execute on the field. Although the football/soccer hierarchy has the manager higher than his/her players, Guardiola speaks to the Manchester City footballers at eye level. This type of communication from the leader to the followers captures a sense of respect going both ways. This mutual respect is key to fulfilling a successful leadership role, in my opinion. Both parties of this ""exchange of respect"" understand that they need each other to build a strong organization, or in the case of the picture, to win football matches."
213,18039,M,"I believe this image encompasses the essence of leadership because as a quarterback, you are responsible for everybody on the field. You must know everything that is going on basically at every single second of the game and are the first person to be blamed for any sort of mistake or team fault. It is the most mentally demanding position, however it also accrues the most recognition and praise. A quarterback is the figurehead of the team, and possesses the capability to uplift other aspects of the team that may not be as strong. On the contrary, other positions on the field can also affect the performance of the quarterback and reflect the preparedness and vigor that each team member possesses, which ultimately circles back to the quarterback."
214,18038,M,"This image depicts two managers and a worker having a conversation in a warehouse. The managers(leaders) are not sitting in an office supervising the workers from above like gods, but are in the field getting their hands dirty. A true leader does not pretend like they are better than the people under than them--this makes them less approachable to feedback, which can create improvement. The leaders seen here are listening intently to what the worker is saying and appear passionate about the work that they are doing. This, in turn, makes the workers care more about the work they are doing in the company, creating a more positive work culture."
215,18036,M,"I chose a picture of Albert Einstein for my image of a leader. Einstein completely changed the world in his work, for better or worse. With Einstein's introduction of the theory of relativity and mass-energy equivalence, his work completely changed the way many people think, and had unintended implications later on with the creation of the atom bomb, forever changing the world politically as well. Although his work was used to create a device of pure destruction, his advances in physics completely changed the industry and the world. Einstein's leadership was not the typical vision of a leader, however. He was not known for his speeches or politics, he was known for his discoveries that took an entire lifetime to pursue. While not constantly being the center of attention or man leading a crowd of people, Einstein took a role as a reserved and distinguished leader in the world of physics and engineering."
216,18032,M,"The image I submitted shows the former UCLA basketball star, Jaylen Hands, picking his teammate's head up after that teammate gave up a turnover at a critical point in the game. This is, in my opinion, the most remarkable example of leadership. Instead of getting angry and letting his teammate slouch and hang his head, he came over and made sure that he kept his head up. Jaylen Hands took it upon himself to reassure his teammate that it was okay and that there was still a bigger goal that had yet to be achieved. He picked his teammate up, and they ultimately won the game 87-84. True leaders lead by example and help others when they are struggling. Jaylen Hands is a perfect example of that kind of leader."
217,18029,M,"The chosen image is a fish leaping from a small bowl of water to a bigger bowl that contains more water. This picture encapsulates the essence of leadership as it demonstrates the importance of risk-taking. The bigger bowl is a metaphor for an opportunity, as it is a larger and more suitable space for multiple fish to live in. However, in order to take advantage of that opportunity, the fish had to take the risk and leap from the smaller to the bigger bowl. Leadership requires the bravery to take risks in order to achieve something better. Now that other fish have seen one fish take the leap and reach the better bowl, they too will follow and jump into that bowl. This shows how a leader, in this case the first fish, has the ability to inspire others who may not have been as courageous in taking the risk to achieve the higher goal. Hence, this picture shows the values required by a leader and the significance of risk-taking in leadership."
218,18022,M,"The image I selected was a lighthouse shining bright in a large sea storm and it accurately represents the essence leadership to me. Even during tough times, as shown by the raging storm, the lighthouse still must stand straight and point in a direction. I compare this to a leaders role of always needing to stay level headed and make good decisions during challenging circumstances. Also, the lighthouse illuminates a path for others to follow, providing guidance when it is necessary, which is one major role of a leader. Lastly, the lighthouse must be consistent and operate every day because people rely on it. In similar fashion, a leader must be consistent and understand that others are depending on the performance of him or her."
219,18020,M,"To me, leadership requires several things, but one of the most important is never asking a follower to do something that the leader doesn't or wouldn't do. Michael Jordan (pictured) was the best at this, and that is what made him such a fantastic leader. He worked harder than all of his teammates and he never asked them to give more than he was giving. This image shoes him supporting his teammates and rooting them on as he's giving high fives. Support and picking up others is also one of the key traits to leadership. This image really embodies that leading is about bringing out the best in others as well as yourself. A great leader makes everyone around them better."
220,18016,M,"In this image we are presented with my high school’s jv cross country team seconds before the race began. Seconds prior to the race, a motivational speech is given by one the varsity’s captain and medalist recipient of that race. I see this image capturing the essence of leadership because it truly shows how everyone is wishing the best for everyone but more importantly it shows how one person can truly impact a group of people to strive for excellence despite the fears behind doing something. Despite being a medal recipient and not part of that jv race, he took the initiative to motivate the team and inspire them to surpass their limits which is essential in leadership which is being able to empower others."
221,18013,M,"I think that when most people think about the concept of leadership, they relate it to a figure such as a politician or a quarterback since they are people who others look upon and are able to command and give orders, usually to obtain a good result. However, I feel like another leader who is not so often looked at is a professor. Professors play an important paper in a student's life, since they're teaching them new topics, new perspectives, and ultimately broadening the students' views on a specific subject, and they might even make the students challenge their own perspectives and question their ideas. Therefore, I feel that teachers capture the essence of leadership, given the new understandings they provide to their students and the ability to introduce information to their lives."
222,18011,M,"Behind every successful leader is an individual who dared to challenge forces bigger than themselves. In the image above, a captain bravely steers into the dangerous, unknown waters ahead of him. The captain understands that this maneuver runs the risk of serious injury or death, not only to himself but for the rest of his crew. Yet leaders, like the captain, do not shy away from risk. They brave the elements in front of them while always regarding the well-being of their peers. In order to shine as a leader, individuals must have courage and tackle any adversity that may hinder their group. Just as the captain is brave enough to sail in rough seas, leaders must rationally face challenges to see their collective succeed. "
223,18009,M,"The image I chose is of a leader guiding his colleagues forward. In my experiences, this best represents my image of leadership in several facets. The first of these is with the idea that a leader does not guide solely himself; as is seen in the image, the leader is holding the hand of the people he leads, and helps the entire group as he places the flag higher up. In addition, the leader does not put himself above those around him, he appropriately leads his colleagues without regarding himself as higher than them. He ensures all of his peers are equally respected. This is the type of leadership that I admire, one that is both helpful to all while also remaining on the same level as peers. "
224,18006,M,"A compass embodies the essence of leadership in three ways. For this context: the compass is the leader, and the user is the team being led. 
 
 Compass set the direction for the team. A leader is inspires a shared vision for the team, setting the direction of the ship to sail to success.  
 Compass stay true to true north, similar to how a leader should stay true to his and his team’s values to enhance team performance.  
 Compass has a transparent face and its users can easily understand how it makes its decisions. Leaders should maintain transparent and open communication with their team. When making difficult decisions, leaders should keep their team updated on their decision making process to align the team to the new decision.

225,18004,M,"My classmates and I in high school studied Martin Luther King in our social justice 12 class. When I think of a leader, someone persuasive and charismatic comes to mind. However, most importantly, a leader is someone who can motivate groups of people and lead them towards a common goal. In the attached picture, Martin Luther King demonstrates such leadership by performing his famous speech. His charisma allows him to move countless people and empowers individuals to follow him. Furthermore, by successfully motivating the people, he earnestly directs them towards the same purpose. One important part of the picture also involves the audience. Notice how people of all ethnicity sits patiently and listens carefully. As a powerful leader, understanding the audience and highlighting goals is crucial."
226,18003,M,"Although there are more glamorous and conventionally important pieces on a chess board, I believe the humble pawn can serve as the essence of true leadership. I believe that being a leader boils down to facing a challenge head-on while simultaneously inspiring those around us through our sacrifice, dedication, and commitment to the success of others. Similar to how pawns attack the opposition and protect the vital pieces on a chessboard, I think a leader should protect his followers by addressing their concerns and tackling challenges head-on as a team. A leader does not necessarily need to flaunt their status or be the king on a chess board but rather needs to inspire those around with their needs, comfort, and concerns in mind. Being a leader means being selfless, caring, and collaborative, and this is why I believe that the pawn on a chessboard encompasses the essence of leadership."
227,18002,M,"The image captures the essence of leadership through the portrayal of the bearded man in a turquoise shirt standing at a higher point on the “hill”, pulling three others—who we can infer are his teammates—up towards him with a rope. From my interpretation of the image, leadership is derived from healthy collaboration. As implied by the image, a leader should have higher qualifications in the subject matter; hence, the reason the man stands at a higher vantage point. However, that leader should also be able to use these qualifications to uplift and inspire their team to reach a common goal. The takeaway from this image is that motivational collaboration is the essence of leadership, because there could be no leader without a team!"
228,18000,M,"The image describes the essence of leadership as the person at the front is not only inspiring and paving the path for people to follow, but he is doing it in a way that is in collaboration with everyone. The person at front is therefore utilizing his leadership in a manner to inspire others and to collectively allow everyone to succeed and go towards the right direction. This prime example of leadership is a demonstration of someone who is able to organize and lead others who may be lost or struggling without purpose or direction. Therefore, leadership is not only about being someone who can lead the crowd but ensure he/she can also assist others in their own personal journey's and bring others along the ride for success."
229,17999,M,"I included a screenshot of a presentation my co-captain and I delivered to our Science Olympiad team a few months before the big tournaments of the year. I worked hard on and was proud of this presentation, in which I attempted to use all of my understanding of leadership to galvanize and motivate the team. The screenshot displays three key components that I currently believe constitute good leadership. 
   
 One such component is dedication to serving the needs of one's team. Prior to holding many leadership roles, I believed that leaders should exclusively focus on ensuring that their team has all of the information and resources they need to excel. I thought being a leader ought to primarily be a service position. My belief in this principle is very visible through the extensive data I presented to the team (some of which is excerpted in the screenshots). In the image, I include benchmarks of past overall and individual event scores to establish how where we were differed from where we should look to be as we headed into states. As the leader of the team, I felt an obligation to provide my team with any worthwhile information I could produce so that they would be more informed in their preparation for states. 
   
 More implicit in this photo is a second key of leadership that I have discovered: effective and genuine communication. I believe that effective leaders not only listen to the needs and advice of their team members, but also attempt to make sure that the entire team agrees on where they stand in relation to their goals. While this particular presentation did not include much of the usual checking in with team members, I nonetheless tried to keep this ethos in mind. I included the past nationals scores of my school and our biggest state rivals in part to establish our collective expectations and make sure the team was on the same page. 
   
 As I gained more leadership experience, I discovered a third principle of leadership: defining, refining, and maintaining the vision of one's team. By the time I made this presentation, I had discovered that viewing leadership purely as an act of direct service to one's team limits its effectiveness. Effective leaders not only work to ensure their team has everything necessary to achieve its collective goal, but also set this goal, maintain morale, and hold people accountable to their potential. Throughout this image, I attempt to proactively set objectives and galvanize the team. I set somewhat lofty score targets for individual events (arrows on graphs). In addition, by referencing our previous (worse than usual) national placing, I attempted to push everyone to do more work than was needed to just squeeze out a narrow victory at states (under the premise that this wouldn't be enough for nationals).

230,17997,M,"This image of Martin Luther King, Jr., at the Lincoln Memorial, taken on August 28, 1963, exactly 60 years ago, captures the essence of leadership. What I see in this image is a brave man, standing before a group of people-- young, old, black, white, poor, and rich– and speaking with the same level of respect and dignity for each person. He is leading by example, with a purpose as he delivers his ""I Have A Dream"" speech sharing his bold ideas with a plan for freedom. The image shows the massive crowd listening intently and looking up to him for guidance and support. He inspires and encourages all people while making it clear he is no better or worse than anyone else. Martin Luther King Jr. will always be a leader. "
231,17994,M,"To me, leadership is about uniting people around a common value or a common mission. It isn't about following a leader. It's about having a leader that encourages people to follow something bigger than themself. People have a natural disposition towards losing themself in aims of something greater. An effective leader recognizes this. Even though I'm not Christian, I find this same idea within Christianity and the followers of Jesus. Jesus united people through God, the epitome of something greater than yourself. God is the greatest value, the greatest mission there can be. It lessens the role of the individual, bringing importance to something that transcends separate selves. God is shared for all beings, bringing followers of Christ together as they connect over something bigger than themselves."
232,17953,M,"In my perspective, I see the essence of leadership through the lens of having a clear vision for what you want to pursue in the future. Through this image, I showcase leadership through having the ability to formulate a solid plan moving forward amidst an environment that often seems blurry and uncertain. A true leader is one who is able to navigate such a blurry environment, one who is able to take that initiative to create impact rather than act as a bystander afraid to take risks. Having the skill to adapt to such blurry scenarios is one of the most defining traits of terrific leaders, a catalyst that is able to sculp future entrepreneurs, visionaries, and trailblazers because of their unique direction even in an environment where the future lies uncertain."
233,17952,M,"The attached image of the Late Sultan of Oman - Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said PBUH - captures the essence of leadership beautifully as I see it because it displays the King in an honorable, authoritative posture wearing the royal badge (Khanjar), symbolizing power and authority upon an event of a conflict. The image of the Sultan displays leadership, given his depiction of such immense strength and precise leadership while wearing his military uniform - a symbol of combat - to establish solidarity with the Omani Army. The image of the King captures the essence of administration as it reminds one of the outstanding accomplishments he has achieved over his five decades of reign, during which he was renowned for his efforts in modernizing Oman and establishing it as a critical piece player in the Middle East."
234,17951,M,"This image exemplifies leadership in multiple ways. The leader, the man with the red tie holding the flag, is leading his group to the collective goal of reaching the top of the mountain using his outstretched arm, thereby also serving his community. Additionally, the leader has created a teamwork based environment in which members trust each other, another aspect of leadership seen in that each team member is holding hands and helping one another. Furthermore, the leader is demonstrating courage, another leadership quality, by guiding his team from the front, the most vulnerable position of the group from the dangers of climbing the mountain. Lastly, the leader exemplifies communication, a crucial aspect of leadership, seen in that his head is turned towards his team, likely verbally communicating. "
235,17950,M,"A great leader demonstrates the ability to take responsibility for their followers while under harsh conditions and always cares for the greater outcome of the team and society. Trees are the perfect example of great leadership as they nurture the environment, offer various protections, and produce oxygen which humans survive on. Trees will always take on the duty of protecting living beings under harsh weathers like strong sun by providing shades to hide in. Additionally, they produce oxygens that humans depend on and offer shelter for small animals. Even when they die, the downed logs will still be a reliable habitat for many organisms. Leaderships revolves around taking immense responsibility for the greater societal good just like how trees maintains the ecosystem with their presence in the environment. "
236,17949,M,"As I see it, the essence of leadership focuses on equality and initiative. True leaders offer direction and participate in the task at hand rather than commanding from the sidelines. No one is above anyone else, and each member has the same goal to accomplish. My picture shows a sherpa leading a group of hikers across a mountain terrain. At the end of the day, everyone has the same goal of climbing the mountain which ties into the aspect of equality. In addition, the sherpa is actively directing the group to the mountain peak rather than slacking off and leaving his weight for the others to carry. An ideal team consists of members equally willing to carry their own weight."
237,17947,M,"Remy embodies the essence of leadership because he is able to efficiently motivate and mobilize a legion of rats to fully operate a 5-star restaurant while maintaining pristine quality and overseeing multiple stations of foods. His leadership profile contains not only a high level of determination, but also a calm and collected steadiness that allows him to stay focused. Despite his physical challenges of being a street rat, it did not stop him from working to achieve his goal of becoming a chef. Remy further demonstrates his leadership skills by taking risks. He was able to identify a comically disastrous scenario that Alfredo Linguini caused with the soup incident but Remy came to the rescue. In return, Linguini spared Remy's life and that eventually escalated to his successful career into Gusteau's. Remy's ability to identify issues, work hard to correct them, and manage a team despite having unexperienced workers emphasize what it takes to be a good leader."
238,17944,M,"I selected George Washington to represent my understanding of leadership, due to his impressive dedication to his country and ability to rise as a founding father for the tranquility of his under-developed nation. The image portrays his unique ability to unite his fellow soldiers for a common purpose of defeating the British forces in the Revolutionary War. Despite not having an abundant amount of experience managing large armies, Washington obtained the confidence and capability of setting personal needs and desires aside in order to create peace for his citizens. In my opinion, leadership can be modeled by individuals who are willing to prioritize the needs of others before one’s own, and can find ways to move past challenges and unite like-minded people in order to achieve a common goal."
239,17942,M,"Depicting the death of the revolutionary leader and journalist Jean-Paul Marat, this painting represents to me the essence of leadership, which is found at the intersection of power and responsibility. Like many leaders, Marat had a vision (after all, he was a revolutionary), but he failed to communicate this to the French citizens effectively; instead, he tried to do it on his own with brute force by abusing his power. A disgruntled citizen murdered him in an act of revenge, killing him and his plans. A vision can only be realized when the people are willing to follow the visionary, and that skill of being able to forge a new path while bringing people along with you is what the essence of leadership is about."
240,17941,M,"In my eyes, the essence of leadership is that true leaders see themselves as no better than everyone around them. Over my 18 years of observing others lead in various situations, some of the most impactful leaders have been those who treated others as equals, if not with greater regard. The attached photo is from this summer at Mt. Triumph Leadership Camp in Cispus, Washington. I believe this photo captures the essence of leadership because my friend Christian and I are in the middle, kneeling. Despite holding the title of ""Junior Counselor,"" our delegates stand above us. This shows our commitment and dedication to supporting our delegates in their journey to becoming the best leaders they can be."
241,17936,M,"I believe that the essence of leadership is about how individuals can impact the communities and the people around them, by equipping them with skills, empowering them to grow and giving them the opportunities to step up and do so. This image I chose is of me being able to share important lessons from my leadership experiences with my high school juniors. 
 I particularly feel that it resonates with my belief in being able to empower these new leaders through open dialogue, about how they can become the change they would want to see in the world through their own actions. In doing so, I was able to impact and give back to the very same community that gave me opportunities to become a leader."
242,17934,M,"This is an image of George Washington leading his men as he crosses the Delaware, where he is leading a surprise attack against a trained Hessian army with his rag-tag group of rebels. This captures the essence of leadership because he is bravely standing up for his values, despite the overwhelming odds against him.  He inspires a group of men to fight a daunting opponent and does so by leading them in the front lines, rather than cowardly commanding his troops from a safer location. The ability to convince a group of people to work together to face a seemingly impossible challenge, and doing so while leading by example captures the essence of leadership."
243,17933,M,"One reason this image may capture the essence of leadership is because it highlights that leaders must be able to communicate effectively. The leader in this scenario is using their speaking ability to share ideas with the public in front of them. A leader should be capable of transforming their ideas into clear statements that others can understand. 
 In the image, the speaker is engaging directly with other people. In my opinion, leaders benefit from strong social skills and the ability to understand others. Being able to consider multiple points of view in addition to their own may improve the quality of a leader in the long term."
244,17932,M,"I chose this picture of four individuals to reflect the essence of leadership. In the picture, it is difficult to decipher who the leader is. This reflects my belief that leadership doesn’t always have to come from a ‘boss’ or a person in another traditional leadership role. Instead, I believe that normal team members can be leaders in school and work - contributing their ideas and providing suggestions. 
   
 Furthermore, all the team members appear to be very engaged, sitting closely together, maintaining eye contact, as well as leaning towards the speaker. An individual’s leadership is often reflected by their ability to influence others. An effective leader will be able to keep a group of people engaged and become more productive in a supportive and collaborative environment. "
245,17931,M,"To me, this image instantly captures the essence of leadership as it portrays the members of the team being guided through and assisted in the process of achieving their goals. The illustration of the palm as a stepping stone for the individuals can be representative of the concept that leaders should be willing to get involved and act instead of expecting the individuals who are under their control to blindly follow their commands. Leaders need to make sacrifices and sometimes that means enduring hardship in order to move from struggle to success. Leaders also need to be able to bear the weight of their team members' issues and for this to happen, they need to be trusted by their team members to make bold decisions.

246,17927,M,"My image of leadership is more-so based off of a quote from Teddy Roosevelt. The quote is, “We must all either wear out or rust out, every one of us. My choice is to wear out.” This quote to me sums up leadership in a great sense. We all have the ability to be idle in life, and not care. That would be rusting out. Instead, taking ahold of situations, being proactive, and leading with care, is the route that will wear you out. But it is also the route filled with integrity and reason. Leading isn’t designed to be fun. I believe that Theodore Roosevelt understood that, and in his eyes, you may as well spend your life wearing out, and leading with passion until you can’t anymore."
247,17926,M,"The essence of leadership, as I see it, is about creating an environment. It is, first and foremost, about creating a professional environment that allows people to be the best versions of themselves. However, it is also about creating an environment where all the people involved can enjoy themselves and feel a sense of belonging. I have chosen this image of people in business attire playing soccer because it symbolizes such an environment. I also believe that this image depicts a group of people working as a team, chasing the same goal, which is what creating such an environment seeks to accomplish."
248,17925,M,"The essence of leadership is crucial in challenging times. Hence, the reason I picked this photo of Bush speaking post 9/11. After the tragic attacks on the Twin Towers, President Bush went out to the buildings where there was debris from the devastation, which the firefighters and construction workers were working on, and delivered a speech. During his speech, he had his arm around a firefighter, showing his genuine compassion, and yelled to all the people attending, ""I can hear you."" His true leadership started to show as he said, ""The people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us."" Bush saying this makes everyone there and in the USA feel unified no matter their background, which is a needed quality of a leader."
249,17921,M,"The essence of leadership is understanding that you are a guide rather than someone who is controlling a team. To encourage the team to collaborate and work together. By doing so, it is more prominent that the team is working more efficiently. Providing guidance through conflicting ideas and possibly helping to create the middle group/compromise. In the image above, we see a hand helping workers cross to the other side. This helping hand is the leader, helping build a bridge for the company and team. A leader helps the team rather than prioritizing themselves above the others and this can be seen through the image. Keeping this in mind is essential in the prosperity of a business and team creating an extremely likable and respectable leader. "
250,17920,M,"You might be wondering why there's a picture of a rusty old cargo ship as my representation of leadership, but the story of Chung Ju Yung's sinking of the  Asia Star  is one of my favorite stories of leadership. As a short background of Chung Ju Yung, he was the founder of the Hyundai Group as well as Hyundai Heavy Industries - the world's largest ship building company. Despite being a poor farmer's son and failing multiple times as an entrepreneur, he became a critical figure and leader during Korea's industrialization period. Though there are many famous stories and quotes of his, I think the sinking of the Asia Star is one of the more notable ones. Having found the Hyundai Group. Chung Ju Yung was ambitious to start Hyundai Heavy Industries. He had wanted to build a massive shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea due to several strategic advantages, yet the location required dredging work to deepen the channel. Both financial institutions and the government claimed that what Chung Ju Yung wanted was impossible and financially expensive. Yet determined, Chung Ju Yung proposed a totally out-of-the-box solution of sinking a old unused cargo ship ""Asia Star"" at the entrance of the shipyard channel to create a foundation for a breakwater, creating a sheltered area for construction. This idea was also scoffed at; however, Chung Ju Yung went through with it and eventually Hyundai's shipyard in Ulsan became one of the largest and most successful in the world. 
   
 From Chung Ju Yung, I believe two important things a leader must possess are a challenging mindset and creative thinking. After coming up with an unconventional yet practical solution, everyone around him claimed it was a ridiculous idea. However, Chung Ju Yung took a risk, overcoming the fear of failure. His determination to get the job done is something I admire. I believe this characteristic of his is very important in leaders who have broadened responsibilities - whether that be your family, your company, or your nation."
251,17919,M,"Dalinar Kholin is the antithesis to the concept that people cannot change. Kholin, the former top general of Alethkar in  The Stormlight Archives , left a trail of destruction and war in his younger years, later reforming into a respected and trusted man. 
   
 A leader is someone who both learns from and takes responsibility for their actions while also not being held a prisoner to them. Essentially, someone who understands that, to quote Dalinar, “the most important step a person can take is always the next one” ( Oathbringer ), for the sake of all involved. 
   
 Power, by nature, is corruptive. Thus, someone who is always focused on improving with each passing moment will be more resistant to this effect, and will always fight for those they represent. "
252,17918,M,"To me, leadership is a multifaceted concept which undertakes contextual meaning. I fundamentally believe that qualities of leadership are inherent, yet distinct. Every individual possesses a unique leadership style and ability which differs in contextual relevance. For instance, a democratic leader would likely fair better in a team of high talented, collaborative individuals; however, they may struggle with dealing with time-based inefficiencies. Conversely, an autocratic leader would likely succeed in increasing efficiency, yet might struggle with ensuring long-term commitment and motivation. 
   
 However, I believe leadership is ultimately rooted in teamwork, in enhancing the team through communication, collaboration, and ingenuity. Aristotle, arguably the original leader in developing philosophical thought, posed that leaders must follow those who they serve, as 'those who cannot be a good follower cannot be a good leader'. The selected photo is representative of this idea, the idea that leadership is achieved through ""branches"" of highly intertwined networks that each work to support one another. Leadership is the process of fostering these networks to engender success, whether that be in the fields of academia, politics, or business. Only though establishing these branches and fostering a team rooted in support and collaboration can the ""tree"" of success grow, and ultimately bloom."
253,17915,M,"Having played baseball for 15 years, 3 of years to boot as my high school team captain and countless unofficially leading my travel teams, the significance of leadership in a sports setting is no mystery to me. Thus, I chose this photo of Kobe Bryant, one of the best leaders in the sport of basketball. Kobe embodied what it means to be a leader, just as depicted in this picture guiding his teammates and instructing them in the moment. As a sports leader myself, I took Kobe’s ethic to heart, teaching and guiding my own team in the moment just as Kobe is pictured here. I see leadership as a form of guidance, using your own experience to help your teammates in any scenario, depicted perfectly here"
254,17914,M,"I think that there are two ways to lead. One way is you can be the head of a team, country, etc. Another way I think that people can lead is by doing something that is not always done. For example, in this image we can see volunteers offering their scarce time to help individuals less fortunate themselves. Even though some of these people are “following” the head of that program or kitchen, I believe that they are also leading. Some individuals might look to them and recognize the good that they’re doing and follow. I think that this is the case with many of the actions we do in our daily life. Some of us are followers and some of us are leaders. But even followers are followed and can lead."
255,17911,M,"Leadership to me can come in different ways. Taking charge in situations when peers are confused or lost. As well as being a role model for the people you are with because the term ""taking leadership"" really means taking a task or obstacle head on so your peers can follow. People like to follow after the ball gets rolling or there is someone taking charge. In this photo you can see the solider in the front holding more baggage than everyone else while having the fastest pace. He is acting as a role model for the soldiers so they keep moving. Putting in hard work into a group project or situation is contagious to those around you. Leadership is needed in all situations to be the most effective and efficient."
256,17909,M,"Empathy is one of the most essential elements of leadership. It allows leaders to truly connect with their team on an emotional level, enabling them to understand their perspectives, motivations, needs, and sentiments. In The Gladiator, Maximus empathizes with Juba, and they share their personal lives and desires, despite the challenging circumstances. Through this, Maximus is able to earn the loyalty and trust of Juba, indicating that he is not only able to command respect through strength and skill but also through compassion and emotion. As a result of this empathetic relationship, they are able to build a formidable team that defeats the leader of the Roman Empire. This image demonstrates that leadership is more than the broad conception of motivating a team through a powerful speech, but also includes the need to cultivate individual relationships to lead a successful team."
257,17906,M,"Jordan Burroughs is a 7 time world/olympic champion for the United States in the sport of wrestling. As long as I can remember, Jordan Burroughs has been a role model for everyone in the wrestling community. His hard work and dedication to the sport sets him apart from his competitors. To me a leader is an individual who inspires others to better their craft through leading by example. In addition, they are great communicators who can motivate others to better themselves and reach their goals. While working with Jordan this past year at Penn, he has allowed me to see my true potential and continue to push myself in the sport. Through injuries and upsets he has reassured me of my abilities and to continuously improve my fundamental skills within the sport."
258,17905,M,"Al Gore epitomizes the heart of leadership, initiating change within his greater community. The former vice president fought for significant environmental progress via public speaking events, educational collaborations, and arguably one of the most impactful documentary films “An Inconvenient Truth” (my favorite documentary of all time). The film explores the complexities within climate change, being one of the first media sources to address the urgency of pollution and climate change. As an innovative figure, Gore was able to convince a global audience that environmental sustainability is a serious topic via his nuanced scientific evidence. Gore’s ability to take risks despite what many individuals say truly represents the essence of leadership. He is able to alter not just the way individuals think, but societies and government too. "
259,17904,M,"In my eyes a leader is someone who aims to provide growth for those they lead. I chose the image of a shepherd guiding a flock of sheep because it symbolizes how impactful one person can be on a large group. The shepherd's job is to bring the sheep to a point where they can graze peacefully and in that way, thrive. It is often a job that takes patience and the occasional sheep may wander off, but a good shepherd keeps their composure until the entire flock is where they need to be. A leader should aim to help everyone who looks up to them and understand that some people may take more time to reach the ""destination"" of those around them. I think a leader is not someone who orders those around them, but instead nurtures them, as a shepherd does with a flock of sheep."
260,17903,M,"A smooth boulder formation, worn by the flow of a strong river, is a picturesque scene to represent the essence of leadership. Much like quality leadership, the boulders are resilient, yet they are worn and influenced by the flow patterns of water. A good leader should hold course and not crumble in the face of immense and constant pressure. The boulder formation has existed for a million years prior, and will continue to exist for a million more, with the same strength as a leader who will not give in to adversity. But a good leader should also take note of those around them, considering thoroughly their advice and sparing no expense to ensure all have a voice in the task at hand. With the boulders, this is evident in erosion patterns: although the boulders are strong and immovable, their shape is influenced by the flow of the water."
261,17843,M,"Leadership can vary and come in many different forms, but at its core, the essence of leadership isn't truly defined through merely holding a leadership title or position, rather, it lies deep within the attitude and work one puts in, no matter what position one may hold. For me, the picture below, in reference to the lower half image, is the best example of a picture that captures the true essence of leadership. A leader should not only be able to guide their members but also should hold an equal responsibility to the group, in helping it succeed in accomplishing the task at hand. A true leader is among their group members not as a spectator, but best as a participant, which is captured below."
262,17842,M,"To me, an individual reading a map to their team members while on a journey perfectly captures the essence of leadership. Each aspect of the situation depicted in the photo can be related to an aspect of leadership. The journey represents the task the team tries to complete, while the map represents the leader's unique knowledge regarding the task at hand. To reach the destination, the leader must apply the directions found on the map and show the rest of the team the correct path. Similarly, for a team to achieve anything, the best leaders can apply their unique situational knowledge so that the whole team can reach their shared goal. The team's journey or shared goal is only accomplished when everyone completes it together."

 I really enjoy chocolate chip cookies. Attached is an image of the ingredients for chocolate chip cookies. The ingredients used to make chocolate chip cookies might not scream ""the essence of leadership"" at first glance, but I do find leadership's essence once the process of making cookies is considered. A leader must utilize the resources at hand. Some resources work best in limited amounts or only in particular areas that they are best suited for. A baker is a leader of ingredients. A baker can effectively take the right amount of ingredients to produce a delicious result. A leader puts assets to use in order to achieve a desirable outcome."
264,17836,M,"Leading by example is the most important component in the essence of leadership, and this is shown by Lionel Messi in the 2022 Fifa World Cup. He showcased leadership by setting an example for the young players on the Argentinian team by staying humble, and treating every match as its own, individual challenge. Furthermore, during the latter stages of the tournament when nerves ran high, Messi stepped further into his role as team captain, leading the team through struggles inside and outside of matches. 
   
 Messi also led the future of soccer across the globe. He served as a role model to young soccer fans by demonstrating that hard work, and persistence truly can bring success, which encapsulates the essence of leadership - more specifically, leading by example."
265,17835,M,"This picture was from when I met Junior Achievement Worldwide's CEO. It reminds me of my journey in becoming a leader and how leaders are meant to inspire others. As leaders, I find it imperative that we strive to better ourselves in order to better others. Our conversation, although brief, allowed me to understand the importance of leadership on a global scale. Leaders don't necessarily need to be the face of a movement so long as they help facilitate a mission. In this case, Junior Achievement's CEO is relatively unknown, while the countless volunteers and staff are the people who are able to change the lives of so many children. Being able to interact with someone of such a high caliber made me realize that it is possible to become a leader like him and create a truly meaningful impact on the world"
266,17834,M,"I chose a picture of my high school graduation. The picture is not of the graduates, however of the proud parents taking pictures. In my opinion, a true leader is one who sacrifices anything for the people who they are leading. They truly and completely want the people they are leading to be better than themselves. I think no one better represents this better than parents. My school was unique in a way in that it was a private, boarding school, so there was a financial burden, but also the burden of parents having to let their kids go significantly earlier than they might have intended. I know first hand how hard this can be on them. However, almost all were steadfast in their ways to ensure that their children would be better suited to succeed than they ever were. Parents are truly the greatest leaders of all."
267,17833,M,"Leadership can be hard to understand, but I feel that the image of an orange best represents my view of its essence. In the wrong hands, an orange is useless. For the person that believes that the orange is inedible, the orange becomes meaningless. Ignorance, or ineffective leadership, destroys the opportunity the orange offers. Under the right leadership, however, an orange could be used for a number of different purposes. It could be eaten, made into juice, or even incorporated into the sole of a shoe. The orange represents the infinite possibilities for success under effective leadership, as well as its meaninglessness under ineffective leadership. Obviously, leadership signifies far more than just the complexities of its proper application. Regardless, by understanding its potential when effectively demonstrated, one can begin to understand its essence."
268,17832,M,"The image I chose encompasses two crucial aspects of leadership simultaneously: collaboration and guidance. This image is of a conference room but from the perspective of the head of the table. This perspective represents the role of the leader, inviting collaboration but taking control when needed. Instead of an image where the leader may be positioned above everyone else, here the message of equality shines through as each person can share their own input to the task at hand. But the difference between just a collaborator and a leader is that when needed, the leader can take charge. People look for direction from a leader during times of confusion or hardship which is why the leader needs to be at the head of the table. "
269,17827,M,"Regardless of what, whom, or where you are leading you must be or seem confident in yourself to appear trustworthy so that people listen. The throne is a symbol of stature and appearance which portrays confidence in the person sitting on it. As royalty, you exude confidence, from the way you dress yourself to the way you pronounce your words. The stiff chair legs, the detailed carvings, and the astute angle collectively comprise what it is to be a leader. You hold yourself high and strong as the legs, you appear knowledgeable and presentable as the carvings and maintain an astute posture to be and seem confident to be a better leader. The symbolism and realism of the throne portray the essence of leadership to the fullest extent. "
270,17826,M,"I chose a captain of a ship as my representation of leadership for a number of reasons. First, he guides the boat, pointing the rest of the team in the right direction. Even though he does not complete all tasks on the boat himself, without him, the completion of those tasks would be pointless. The boat would not go straight. Next, the crew has to look up to him, both physically and emotionally. He stands at a higher point physically, but they also must admire him since he has won command of the ship, meaning he has earned the respect of the crew. Finally, he has to be loud to get his orders across, making sure that he is understood, showing the importance of communication. Being guiding, respected, and communicative are all critical to being an effective leader."
271,17825,M,"The picture I have attached is one of my high school. The picture symbolizes leadership to me because the headmaster of the school David Jackson is one of my closest mentors. Four years ago Mr. Jackson joined Canterbury, right before the start of Covid-19. Not only was it a troubling time around the world, Canterbury had just lost half of its faculty and student enrollment in the 5 years prior. Mr. Jackson was tasked with hiring over 30 new faculty, raise in enrollment by hundreds, and stabilizing the Canterbury School endowment. During a time of uncertainty, Mr. Jackson rose to the occasion and empowered the school to higher heights never seen before. To me, Mr. Jackson is the epitome of a leader. He is someone who builds and strengths his team from the ground up. I aspire to become like him one day."
272,17822,M,"This image captures an important facet of leadership: knowing how to motivate others. I have gone to sleep-away camp for eight years (as both a camper and counselor) and at the conclusion of each summer is an event called ""Color War."" The campers are divided into red and gray for 4 days and play each other in every sport. Each team has a counselor chief who is tasked with leading the team. 
   
 Andrew, the red counselor chief, on the final morning of color war, woke his team up and brought them to the fire pit to burn grey t-shirts. Andrew did this to get the team psyched for the final day. He knew the demographic of the people he is leading and used that to his advantage: fire is cool to children. Andrew did a good job at ""rallying the troops"" because he appealed to the audience. 
   
 A successful leader appeals to their audience and strategies accordingly. Different groups of people will require different methods of motivation."
273,17821,M,"Aside from being a world renown leader who led Europe towards the defeat of Nazism, this picture of Sir Winston Churchill has more meaning behind it. For me personally a leader is someone who leads a group by he himself doing the hard work in the same way that members at the bottom of the hierarchy in the group do. The fact that Sir Winston Churchill is carrying a machine gun, demonstrates that he carries and knows how to use the same weaponry as soldiers in the infantry who he leads. There is no point in being a leader who just simply gives orders and never does the hard work, here Churchill shows exactly the opposite, humility,   he was clearly a leader of the people who was willing to carry out all jobs as a leader to lead the country to Victory. During tough times leaders have to have humility and do the tough work themselves and this is what we see here. "
274,17819,M,"For me, the essence of leadership is about gathering group(s) of people together for a clear purpose. In the selected image, leadership is shown through the male working side by side with his group. The way he positions himself when showing the way to his teammates truly captures the essence of leadership. 
   
 Being a leader is not about bossing or telling others what to do, but rather about opening paths for every member of a team to find their best version. Greater efficiency will be reached when group members feel stakeholders and not solely mere workers, and the essence of leadership, in my opinion, has to involve the need for collective involvement and group work. Certainly, someone must lead a way, just as a soccer team captain does, however every single member of the team must do their part so that the goal is scored. This metaphor extends itself to any group situation."
275,17818,M,"The image I chose is called a “starting 11 photo”. Soccer teams will take this picture before games to remember what people started on the field for specific games. In this particular photo and this particular season, I was voted team captain and got to wear the arm band for every game. Even though I am the only one wearing the band signifying my role of leadership, it is important to note that I stand and play along side them everyday. It takes a fantastic follower to be a leader and I try to take this concept into everything I do. The best leaders are people who listen when others talk, empathize with others experiences, and enjoying seeing things from different perspectives. I believe this image is a good representation of why there is a captain on the field in sports and not just a coaching staff on the sideline. The captain is someone that all the players respect because of their shared experiences and their ability to listen and communicate with the entire team."
276,17816,M,"Leadership goes beyond the superficial of giving orders to others or taking the reins on projects. I believe that a leader actively and intentionally looks after those who are around them with the goal of uplifting them up to higher standards. A leader doesn't look back nor stall time for a situation to possibly get worse. The picture above shows how leaders have that sense of urgency that makes them quick thinkers and active members of society itself. In any setting, leaders are going to be the ones who take control of a situation because they are proactive in creating a collaborative and safe environment that they seek to protect. This image shows how leaders care about those around them and prioritize an individual's well-being. "
277,17815,M,"For me, the essence of leadership is  inspiring   and motivating  people to work toward a shared, greater goal. Ordering people to complete tasks without inspiring them is possible, but it seems to me that this reflects the actions of a good manager, not a good leader. A good leader should be able to earn the trust and respect of their subordinates to inspire and motivate them. 
 In this context, I think the picture below showing Teddy Roosevelt with Panama Canal workers is a good representation of effective leadership. In no way was Roosevelt obligated to travel all the way to Panama and visit the construction site with workers, but he did it anyway. I do not know how the workers felt, but getting a visit from such a high ranking officer must have been inspiring and motivating."
278,17812,M,"In the recent film  Oppenheimer , scientist Neils Bohr (right) recognizes a young Robert Oppenheimer’s affinity for theoretical physics and dissatisfaction with conducting lab experiments for Patrick Blackett (left). By virtue of his extensive scientific background, Bohr recommends Oppenheimer leave Blackett’s lab to study quantum physics at Göttingen. Juxtaposed with Blackett’s limiting teaching practices, Bohr exhibits perceptive leadership in his social-emotional awareness and versatile problem solving. Effective leaders listen to others, identifying both their goals and the specific obstacles they face in attaining them. Rather than employing generic strategies for progression, their expertise allows them to find personalized solutions for the person/team. Bohr’s natural awareness for Oppenheimer’s feelings and aspirations represents how the essence of leadership is the ability to bring out the best in others."
279,17809,M,"Leadership is a quality that's universally relevant, whether you're talking about a small ice cream shop or a massive corporate setting. But for this discussion, I chose Captain John Miller, brought to life by Tom Hanks in the film ""Saving Private Ryan."" While the movie explores a range of themes, leadership stands out prominently. Captain Miller's leadership essence shines as he fearlessly leads by example amidst chaos, making swift decisions under relentless pressure. His deep empathy and unwavering commitment to the mission foster an unbreakable bond with his team, showcasing the core tenets of exceptional leadership. The picture showcases a screenshot of Captain Miller doing just this, commanding and leading the team to fight the enemies. He embodies the very essence of leadership into every pivotal moment, which is why I chose him."
280,17808,M,"The essence of leadership lies in bringing out the best qualities in oneself and doing the same for others. In other words, to lead a group, a family, a community, or even a country, one must first know how to lead oneself. As exemplified by the image I chose (a tree), a successful team can be visualized as an oak whose firmness is attributed to its foundations (the values displayed by the leader and shared with the team). Hence, a good leader is one who knows how to use their own distinctive skillset and beliefs as a positive input to make the collective abilities of their team thrive, that is, being the roots of the group's success but leaving room for each member to flourish."
281,17807,M,"In my opinion, a great leader is to teach and support the education and development of each team member. The stronger the members’ skills, the more productively they operate, the more efficient and adaptive team we have. 
 It’s also important to note the adaptational strength of the teaching and mentoring part of leadership. From one side, it’s really time consuming to teach anybody. But then look at the outcome: spending our “leader-resources” (like time and budget) on special inner and outer educational programs for stuff we provide ourselves with so far greater opportunities to delegate and as a result take more interesting and strategically focused tasks and projects ourselves. Moreover, thanks to the spiral effect (with properly built educational system) your team will continue to teach new members and uprise the level of the whole organization."
282,17804,M,"Through the use of rock climbing, your belayer guides you on your journey, slowly but surely assisting the climber on their way up the cliff. Guidance is what a leader does, they help you on this journey, whatever it may be, while preparing themself to do the climb next. Leadership, is not necessarily just the act--rather it is the journey you take to accomplish the collective goal. The goal of rock climbing is to get to the top of the cliff, while yes there are times you can reach this peak by yourself, you may need someone to guide you. The belay is here to help you, just like a leader, they are here to guide you and not tell you how to do it."
283,17800,M," For me, this image represents leadership indirectly. Personally, I correlate with being a good leader and being a good mentor, and throughout my childhood I always remembered Mufasa as a great and wise mentor as he taught Simba the ropes of the kingdom before passing away. Mufasa not only mentored his son Simba, but he also took care of all the animals in his prairie, fulfilling the role of King of The Jungle in a way that made those around him thrive as a leader should. On the other hand, Scar prioritized himself over the wellbeing of the prairie when he took over, and the entire ecosystem deteriorated. Thus, in my opinion, Mufasa is the perfect example of a leader, a mentor who ensures the wellbeing of the people around him, while ensuring continuity through mentorship to his family and community.

284,17798,M,"In my opinion leadership is the capability of someone to give orders and take constructive decisions for a group of people, always seeking the best for them. At the same time he must be liked, admired and respected by this group and his final word should always be accepted by them. In the picture below we clearly a character standing in front of a big group of other characters who seem to be happy there. The picture is a representation of the movie “The Lion King” (my favorite movie growing up) and the main character Simba becomes the leader of the animal kingdom. He also has all the attributes that I cited previously. He is therefore a good leader.So in conclusion this picture represents the essence of leadership and shows how a character can be a good leader. 
  "
285,17794,M,"The image I selected shows Laxman Narasimhan, Starbucks CEO, working a shift as a barista. In the image, Mr. Narasimhan is being taught how to use the equipment by an employee. The image reflects a growing sense of responsibility by company executives to truly understand company operations at every level. By taking time to work this shift, Mr. Narasimhan is showing leadership by fostering a culture of teamwork and understanding. More and more, leaders are realizing that they have a responsibility to serve, whether that be employees, constituents, or other team-members. By working together, Mr. Narasimhan is showing that Starbucks values its employees and their feedback. Morever, he is helping to create a sense of unity, which is a great asset for any team or organization."
286,17793,M,"From my experience with high school House Leadership, I have derived that it is not an individual endeavor. While the allure of leadership is often gaining a position of power or receiving personal recognition, the motivation of an effective leader is rather the pursuit of a collective goal while supervising and learning from a team of contributors. I have learned that to perform effectively, I would need to go below my position to assist struggling team members and simultaneously step beyond my perceived capabilities to push the common agenda toward success. This balancing act is accrued naturally if you and your team engage with humility and reach a state of harmony with mutual respect and shared aspirations. If this is achieved, success is imminent!"
287,17792,M,"A leader motivates and supports their teams through their actions and words, as opposed to a “boss” who imposes their authority through words only. The essence of leadership captured in the photo above is the act of leading by example. In the picture, the leader is shown to be actively engaged in the same task as that of his team, setting the same expectation for themself as they do for others. By supporting the team around them, a leader is depicted to be able to achieve their goals in a more straightforward and organised manner. Furthermore, the image also captures the importance of communication, with the speech bubble above the leader emphasising how an effective leader can leverage their words to motivate and manage a team."
288,17791,M,"The essence of leadership is cultivating an environment that reflects one’s values or those of their community, often at a high level. The attached photo displays a student diligently helping her peer understand and complete a difficult assignment. The helpful student cultivates a culture of collaboration and kindness by enthusiastically sharing her knowledge and time. Notably, her leadership is a combination of a valued action— helping others— and enthusiasm, which reinforces the value of her actions. Moreover, the students appear to be peers; this suggests that one may be a leader without a “leadership position,” vessels that empower some leaders to create change. "
289,17790,M,"Primarily, this picture represents leadership to me because it portrays a person seemingly illuminated with an idea or stimulant, and sharing this idea with a collective of people. Alternatively, this can also depict someone willing to take charge of a situation and a group by initiating their own sense of responsibility and ideas, thus evoking a strong sentiment of leadership. However, this image also strikes me as one of leadership because it potentially portrays someone simply asking a question, and in fact, the only person in the collective to ask a question, which empowers the sense of leadership - not having fear to speak one’s mind and question what is being given to them- . "
290,17782,M,"This is the man who took the famous picture of the construction workers having lunch on top of the yet-to-be-fully-constructed Empire State Building. He is taking the very same risk as the construction employees, all to observe them doing their work. To me this perfectly represents what a leader should be able to do (even though the photographer was obviously not leading the construction). They should be able to do the same dirty work as his followers (in this case the dirty work being balancing above a 850 foot drop) if they are to at all judge them. A CEO of a SaaS company should be able to debug the code of his SWEs just as much as they should be able to tinker the slides of his marketing lead, and only then can they observe/judge/lead."
291,17750,M,"To me, leadership is all about supporting others and forming a strong team. Together, a group of well led people can accomplish far more than individuals can on their own. Leadership is about setting a good example and creating a safe space of accountability, responsibility, and camaraderie. In such a team, everyone must hold each other accountable, for without accountability, everything falls apart. Similarly, this image helps to capture this spirit because if one person fails to lean back or lift another, everyone falls down. Within a team, leadership is vital to keep people on track to reach goals, complete projects, and boost productivity. When everyone is cooperating and united, such as in this picture where everyone plays their role, goals can be easily achieved."
292,17748,M,"I believe the essence of leadership is understanding. Being a leader is utilizing the different forms of understanding whether that's sympathy, empathy, or a general eagerness to understand another's perspective. Especially when there are differences within the group, a leader must be able to unite under a common cause, and demonstrate integrity and unity in the face of adversity. The essence of leadership is bringing people together, and creating unity, where no single person is larger than the other. By applying this, a leader can form a group, or an agenda, that properly serves others and can better impact those around them. In this photo, this is demonstrated, because everyone around the globe, no matter their differences, are united, and no one is larger than the other. "
293,17746,M,"A leader, in my opinion, helps people bring out their best qualities and provides them with a clear vision and common objective. Leaders must also understand their followers' strengths and weaknesses to delegate assignments better and create an efficient workforce. 
 One person who I believe is a true leader is professional soccer player Lionel Messi. In this picture, we see him holding the World Cup trophy while at the same time being praised by everyone around him. True leadership is displayed as Messi, together with his team, celebrates the success of their common objective. You can also see them looking up to him as a hero for his leadership in bringing together a group of soccer players and making them the best in the world."
294,17744,M,"I chose an image of Tim Tebow, a former Heisman Trophy winner. Tebow perfectly embodied leadership, which propelled him and his teammates to 3 BCS National Championships. He not only was an effective vocal leader but he also lead by example. He consistently worked hard in and out of the gym to improve his football skills while encouraging his teammates to do the same. Tebow is a great communicator who is able to share his values and beliefs with others, like members of his football team. He does so in a way that is respectful and acknowledging of other peoples' experiences and ideologies. Additionally, his unfailing confidence and positivity motivates peers to believe in themselves, like he does."
295,17743,M,"I believe that at the core of any leadership is a belief: whether that’s a belief that your startup is going to become a unicorn and you’re going to lead your team of 20 employees there or your belief that the government is corrupt/abusive and that you need to lead an uprising for all the people victimized by it. The picture I chose encapsulates the latter and is a still from The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, where Katniss Everdeen (pictured on the right) is seen holding up a three-finger salute––a symbol of defiance and rebellion. While Katniss never intended to become the leader of a rebellion and a symbol of hope to all the people affected by the class/District system, she did. I believe that because of her deep-rooted belief (that the government doesn’t own her or anyone else), she was successful, and is why she perfectly exemplifies the essence of leadership."
296,17742,M,"In order to lead a group of people, I believe the most vital thing is to lead by listening. As depicted in the picture, the person listening (the leader) has an ear that takes up almost all of their head. When you listen to someone it is imperative to be an active listener and give the speaker your full attention in order to grasp the full mental and emotional situation that they are trying to convey. If a leader does this then they are better equipped to make productive changes to their organization for they are not only understanding what their colleagues want but also why they want it. In addition to this, a leader who listens will be appreciated by their employees (if this is a professional setting) and will be more inclined to work more efficiently for happier employees make for more productive workers. In conclusion, the crucial essence of leadership is listening and listening wholly."
297,17741,M,"I feel that the image of mining captures the essence of leadership. The qualities and skills of humans often have to be sought after or extracted, much like precious materials from the Earth. A strong leader should be skilled in locating and extracting these precious skills from their partners or coworkers. The second way that this image captures leadership is the multiple people extracting precious materials. A strong leader should create an atmosphere that encourages all teammates to extract strengths from each other so that everyone is bringing out their best qualities. Thus, it’s crucial for leaders to not only “mine” for the best qualities out of everyone but also to craft an atmosphere that encourages everyone’s best. "
298,17739,M,"In my opinion, to achieve success, a good leader must empower his team. It is for this reason I strive to practice ethical leadership in all aspects of my life. Following the principles of ethical leadership will help me become the best leader I can be. This image represents my personal leadership experience. As the captain of the Quizbowl team, I took us from 0-8 in our school’s first year to winning the district title and being the regional runner-up. I did this by encouraging my teammates to expand their knowledge base, building up team member confidence, and establishing a strong culture of support, trust, and collaboration within our squad. Through the team, I found my voice as a leader and grew my ethical leadership skills."
299,17737,M,"My image of leadership is an inverted pyramid, which is a symbol for the way true leaders serve as the vital foundation for the organizations that they are a part of. 
 Rather than the traditional stereotype of leaders who sit at the top of an organization and give orders to those below them (i.e. a standard pyramid), a true leader is the person at the very bottom who is lifting everyone else up. 
 Just like how an inverted pyramid requires a delicate balance upon one critical point, true leaders are the critical footing that will make or break the success of the movements they lead. If they aren't willing to get their hands dirty and lift everyone else up, the entire organization crumbles to the ground."
300,17736,M,"The essence of leadership is best described as inspiration. Good leaders must inspire the people that they lead. A lightbulb represents this inspiration because lightbulbs suggest new ideas. Leaders must inspire their followers to think creatively and pursue their passions to become leaders themselves.  This lightbulb  inspiration is essential to leadership because without it leadership is not sustainable. Current leaders have to pass to torch to future leaders for leadership to endure. Think of the U.S. Presidents: they led America and inspired citizens to take greater roles in government (volunteers, representatives, officials, cabinet members, and future presidents), helping their followers to climb the long ladder of leadership. Lightbulbs symbolize new ideas, and leadership is a series of lightbulbs spearheaded by both current and eventual leaders."
301,17732,M,"Anyone who has ever performed in a musical group knows the value of a maestro or conductor. At the most basic level, the conductor keeps the performers in time, cues them in for entrances, and provides cutoffs for when a group should stop playing. What makes a conductor an impressive leader though is that they can listen, react, and ignite emotion in their performers. If the group gets off time, the conductor must adjust to compensate, get the groups’ attention and bring them back on track. Their style of conducting, and how vigorously they perform dictates the speed, volume and emotional style that the performers play. It’s truly this listening factor that makes a good conductor such a valuable leader rather than simply the instructions they give.  
 
"
302,17730,M,"The image I chose to capture what I believe is the essence of leadership and how I see it is a picture that has the word respect on it. I believe with leadership there are a lot of different essences or qualities that an individual must have to claim to be a leader. However, the one key aspect with how I see leadership is through respect. Being able to gain and have the respect of those who you display leadership to is the most important component. They can disagree with you all they want but at the end of the day if you have gained their respect they are still willing to be guided and lead by you."
303,17729,M,"“Be the leader of your own journey.” 
 
 I love and hate that phrase. In one respect, it values self-reliance, but it also overlooks that fact that we rely on each other for our greatest successes. 
 
 I prefer not to give leadership a singular authority, even if that authority is Me. 
 
 In my crowning achievements, leadership has involved a diverse ensemble of roles: those who lead by their actions or resonate with their voices or become vital support players, not just echoing the leader but wielding the power to challenge. From my purview, leadership is not simply being the torchbearer; it's about contributing to this dynamic interplay. 
 
 I chose this image of a Swiss Army knife because among the the many forms that leadership assumes, a different tool is unfolded. We serve multiple purposes with multiple groups of people, and it is all so adaptable and versatile."
304,17728,M,"In my eyes leadership is the act of paving the way for other people, inspiring others and providingunconditional support. As seen with the top half of the photo I have selected below leaders are people who help their peers just as if they are one of them. A real leader would not act like the person in the bottom photo, they don’t put others down, look down on them or push all the work onto them but rather work with them as a team, lift them up and treat everyone equally regardless of status . A leader should be someone that people look up to, someone that people can learn from, reach out in times of difficulty and the first person they find after an achievement."
305,17727,M,"This image of Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers captures my understanding of the essence of leadership in terms of communication, staying calm under pressure, and collaboration. Starting with communication, this image illustrates how Rodgers is communicating with his team to make sure everyone is on the same page with a common goal in mind. When it comes to staying calm under pressure, it is important to note how there is only 12 seconds left in the game, and in spite of that Rodgers is staying calm and making sure to be a stable beacon for the team to accomplish their goals. Finally, it is important to note the collaboration in this picture as the team is huddled together in a close knit manner to ensure that no member of the team is left out and that everyone is on the same page. With those three facets in mind, it is clear that this image of Rodgers and his team embodies leadership."
306,17725,M,"I chose a photo of my late grandfather and I working on my Eagle Scout project. On the back of his truck, he taught me a proper technique to mark where I wanted to cut the wood. His leadership was effective because he could explain the concept, demonstrate proficiency, and then wait and watch as I hoped to mimic his expertise. His hands-on teaching style clearly got his point across with maximum retention. Leadership also requires a great deal of patience, and he displayed this when watching me begin with poor drawings before teaching me how to fix my technique. Finally, I think this photo shows two concentrated and determined people, whose motivations--a service project--demonstrate many profound aspects of leadership."
307,17723,M,"Two components of leadership that come to mind when I think of the essence of leadership are empathy and sacrifice. In order to practice good leadership, one must be able to create practical solutions that take into account the perspective of all parties. To do this, empathy, the ability to understand the feelings of another, is needed. Additionally, leadership requires sacrifice. Time, money, energy, and power are often given up by leaders in order to achieve the greater good for their party. The drawing below captures both components of leadership. The leader can be seen understanding what the other person has to say and, in turn, answers with a practical solution that keeps his heart whole and replaces the lost half of the other person’s heart."
308,17720,M,"Below is a photograph from a recent United Nations general assembly. The image represents a formal example of modern day leadership. Although they aren't lawmakers, each of the individuals make decisions and engage in discourse that affects billions of people through influence on policy from fiscal to social. We can often associate true leadership with people who strive to better the world around them. Within the United Nations, representatives come into the assembly with the interests of their nation for the present and future generations while also aiming to achieve peace with those around the world. Leadership can range from local to international and the United Nations through sanctions and peace treaties shows the true magnitude of international leadership."
309,17719,M,"To me, the essence of leadership consists of inclusiveness and supporting everyone through the process of reaching the final goal. Being inclusive and guidance is an essential part of leadership as it can result in the group's growth and progress in future, rather than focusing on a short-term goal. 
 I believe this image captures the essence of leadership as it shows the leader guiding the group towards the top of a mountain and making sure everyone is included. The leader of the group looks behind him and everyone is holding hands, which ensures no one will be left behind. Additionally, rather than just shouting orders from the back, the leader puts in work and guides the rest of the group to success. Through this, the group is progressing towards their goal."
310,17718,M,"Back in Kenya we complain about tribalism and corruption, yet many gladly take the job they were given because of their second names, and bribe traffic police to evade arrest. We are uncomfortable sacrificing our comfort to look at the bigger picture, thereby making us our own worst enemies in progress. 
   
 In my view, the essence of leadership is service, and that calls for sacrificing one’s self-interests for the greater good of the others. Servant leadership calls for empathy, which I believe is demonstrated clearly in the picture taken in a village near kalahari desert. All the three are clearly hungry, but the older two have put their self-interests aside to care for the younger one who is weak and defenseless before caring for themselves."
311,17717,M,"As I think about what the essence of leadership means to me, the first thought to pop in my head is my hometown, New York City - the place where, I was taught how to thrive and how to be a leader myself. Growing up in such a dense and busy city from a young age, one must learn to both be led and become the leader. A parent, a friend, or a stranger could teach you the order of the avenues, or how to stay safe on the streets. You can point the confused tourist toward the nearest subway station, or walk them down the block to help them find a hidden building in your neighborhood. And branching further, New York is a hub for so many sectors of our world - financial, diplomatic, culinary, and more. In a variety of facets, this metropolis clearly demonstrates the essence of leadership to me."
312,17714,M,"I have chosen a famous image of Martin Luther King Jr. in jail for leading civil rights protests. This image represents true leadership because it shows the sacrifice MLK has shown in order to lead the civil rights movement and represents how a leader is willing to make sacrifices in order to help further the goals of the group he is leading, in this case the civil rights movement. Additionally, this image shows the ideal of perseverance, which is also an important part of leadership. Leaders need to be able to adapt to hardships and setbacks, as King does by writing his famous ""Letter from Birmingham Jail"" while serving his sentence. This image represents the ideals of perseverance and sacrifice as they apply to leadership."
313,17712,M,"To me, the essence of leadership is not only reflected in the traits of a leader but also in the traits of those that look up to a leader. A good leader is one that makes others feel comfortable and secure, remains authentic and confident, and demonstrates a desire to learn and grow. The image I chose represents the essence of leadership because teachers are one of the first figures that children look up to in life. Although the teacher isn't shown in the image, both the emotions of the students and their willingness to participate reveal the teacher's positive influence as a leader. As supported by the image, a true leader will keep people engaged and interested while creating efficient growth in those around them."
314,17711,M,"For a person to be qualified as a leader and have good leadership skills, they must possess many different qualities that relate to many different people. The essence of leadership boils down to one's ability to successfully lead a group of people to accomplish a task. This task could range from leading a tour around your school to running a multi-million dollar company, or to leading a football team to a championship. Leaders are not always to best athlete on the team or the smartest in the classroom, rather they are usually the people who work the hardest so that they not only succeed themselves, but they also wish people around them succeed as well. To summarize, leadership is the ability someone has to lead a group of people to accomplish something bigger than oneself."
315,17708,M,"To me, leadership's core embodies that internal sense of control, coupled with the respect and trust earned from those around you, essential for crafting the finest decisions. For me, this essence of leadership finds its purest reflection in the New York City skyline—my home, my haven. Every time my eyes lock onto that breathtaking tapestry, it stirs up a rush of promise and unmatched opportunity, solidifying the belief that ""if you can thrive in the Big Apple, success is your companion anywhere."" As I navigate through the shifting tides of change in my journey, I constantly remind myself that the city's spirit resides deep within. I have conquered challenges amidst the backdrop of NYC, aided by a medley of programs tailored for its youth, a globally acclaimed government standing as a beacon of progressiveness and change, and the sheer pulse of energy that courses through the city's veins. These very qualities embody the traits I hold dear in a leader."
316,17704,M,"My understanding of a leader is someone who has the ability to effectively take charge or command the room in a way that involves everybody, yet feels personal. Having the ability to speak to confidently to everyone is one thing, but making all participants feel special at the same time is what differentiates a good leader from a mediocre one. 
 The image below captures the essence of leadership through that same idea. Most people in the photo, if not all, are giving their undivided attention to who I would call the leader. The key aspect in this snapshot is the expressions on the participants faces and their body language; they want to listen to him rather than feeling forced to. A true leader is chosen."
317,17703,M,"The image I chose depicts the ""trust fall"" game, where one person falls backward and ""trusts"" their friend to catch their fall. I would say that the essence of leadership is building actionable trust—a phrase I just made up, meaning trust that allows the agents to expand their action space. Inherently leadership occurs between people. For people to accomplish things, they must trust each other. Thus leadership boils down to building relationships of mutual trust. 
 Every great world leader builds trust with their communities. Institutions ""lead"" systems in the economy, the political sphere, and so much more by building reputations worth trusting. Authority becomes natural as people trust their leader. Then with trust established, leaders can comfortably take more risks and achieve a wider variety of goals."
318,17701,M,"When I think of leadership, the lead part of the word sticks out. I think of leadership as the act of guiding others on the way to achieving their goals through leading by example, as the picture below shows. This leading can be verbal or physical. The leader in the picture actively supports the other people instead of just telling them what to do from afar. The leader groups himself with the other people, and he seems like more of a peer or facilitator than an authority figure. I think that authority is important in leadership, but leaders can have influence on others by seeming relatable to them instead of projecting a sense of superiority."
319,17700,M,"The Coronation of Napoleon  depicts Napoleon crowning himself Emperor of France before political figures and the Pope. You might ask: you think a propagandist image of an egotistical, overly ambitious, insecure dictator who, despite his successes, failed to adapt militarily and led hundreds of thousands of his men to their death in agonizing defeats captures the essence of leadership? Well, not quite. Frequently, leaders are egotistical, overly ambitious, and insecure. While these qualities may drive leaders to the top, they ultimately lead to poor leadership. Considering historical context, this ludicrously self-aggrandizing painting encourages me to look beyond the facade of Napoleon’s heroic image to see his internal weaknesses, revealing that successful leadership is based upon inner fortitude and a genuine commitment to your group over yourself. 
 David, Jacques-Louis.  The Coronation of Napoleon . 1805-07. Oil on canvas. 244 x 385 in.. Louvre Museum, Paris. https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010065720"
320,17699,M," This image captures leadership for me because of the story behind it. In the picture, you can see Messi leading the Argentinian side during the semifinals of the last World Cup. It’s necessary to remember that Argentina became champions, with a unique and breathtaking tournament, in which Messi finally accomplished his career dream of winning the World Cup, after several unsuccessful attempts. The media was all over the Argentinian, waiting for another defeat, which never came. 
   
  It inspires me because of what I learned from this situation, being under an extreme amount of pressure and stress, in a difficult situation and with the weight of the terrible defeats of the past. Sometimes you have to forget all that surrounds you, take a step forward and believe in yourself, know your strengths and weaknesses, and use them in your favor. What happened in the last World Cup taught me a lot about leadership, It’s not easy being the image of your team (or an enterprise) and feeling that the careers of your colleagues depend on you, sometimes you just have to take the first step, a risky decision that goes out of the routine and what is easy to make a difference, even if it didn't work in the past."
